The first ever fully synchronized sound cartoon, XXXX Disney's Mickey Mouse makes his screen debut in the exceptionally entertaining cartoon short subject "Steamboat Willie". Mickey is a worker on a steamboat under the supervision of captain XXX Leg Pete(or Pete as he would later be called). Mickey boards his long time companion XXXXXX Mouse aboard the train as they frolic about, while Mickey attempts to impress XXXXXX. This short was wildly fun and positively entertaining. Animators XXXX Iwerks, Rudolph Ising, and Hugh Harman assisted Walt on the creation of the short."XXXXXXXXX Willie" essentially marks the beginning of the success of the Walt Disney Company.
