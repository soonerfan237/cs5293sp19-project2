OK, I admit it, I'm 40 and still shed a tear every time I watch XXXXXX calling back his Robot at the end.<br /><br />"Robot, now stop! Don't do it, stop the attack...XXXXX, what are you doing, XXXXX... XXXXX, where are you goingXXXXX, come back! XXXXX...XXXXX please! Don't do it, you'll die... Robot... Robot, please comeback! I need you hereGiant Robot... Robot! XXXXX Robot" -Johnny Sokko, The Last of Emperor Guillotine<br /><br />Of all the Tokusatsu thats out there, XXXXX robot has a special place in my heart and will always be there. I credit it with getting me into everything sci-fi and anime when i was a kid. <br /><br />LIVE ON GR!
