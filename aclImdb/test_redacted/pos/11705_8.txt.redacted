This is the first feature film from Australian comedian XXXX XXXXXX. XXXX wrote the film with his brother XXXXXXX with help from XXXX XXXXXX, another comedian and actor. XXXX & XXXX also have starring roles along with several other iconic Australian actors - XXXX XXXXXX, XXXXX XXXXXX et al. The basic premise of the movie is that slimy XXXX XXXXXXX (XXXX XXXXXX) has become a member of a Lawn Bowls Club for the sole purpose of getting a free car park near his work. The Club is in dire financial straits and calls on XXXX to help. XXXX XXXXXX plays the clubs arch nemesis - he is trying to take the club over and turn it into a "XXXXX XXXXXXX XXXX" XXXX and the other club members band together to try and save the club with many funny twists and turns and XXXXs eventual redemption. This is quite a clever little movie. It is well above XXXX XXXXXXs usual gutter humor. It is pretty well written and well acted. The older Aussie actors are brilliant (XXXX XXXXXX, XXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXXX and ors) The film meanders along rather then going at break neck pace, but that adds to the charm of the movie. There is low level coarse language.
