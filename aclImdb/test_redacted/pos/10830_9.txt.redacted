In the runaway to Bordeaux, they meet in the train Camille (Virginie Ledoyen), the young assistant of the physicist Professeur Kopolski (Jean-Marc Stehlé), who is trying to leave France with his research of heavy water. Once in Bordeaux, the group meets XXXXXXX with her new lover, the minister of state Jean-Étienne Beaufort (XXXXXX XXXXXXXXX), and is chased by a German spy, the journalist XXXX XXXXXXXX (XXXXX XXXXXX), while Paris is falling and the population is confused. <br /><br />What a delightful and magnificent romantic adventure "XXX XXXXXX" is! The excellent and complex screenplay has action, romance, war, comedy, espionage, drama and lots of characters, played by a fantastic cast, indeed a constellation of stars; the direction is stunning; the music score is wonderful. I really loved this marvelous film, and I have to finish my review due to my limitation of adjectives to describe such a gem. My vote is nine.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Viagem do XXXXXXX" ("Travel of the Heart")
