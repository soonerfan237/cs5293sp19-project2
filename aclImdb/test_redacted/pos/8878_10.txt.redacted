This movie was one of the rolling on the floor laughing movies I have ever seen. XXXXX De Vito plays Owen perfectly. Momma is excellently portrayed, and was one of the highlights of the movie.<br /><br />At the beginning of the movie it starts of differently then what you would expect. XXXXX is trying to write a book and is having some troubles. XXXXX teaches a writing class and Owen tagged after XXXXX trying to get him to read his story. Owen eventually asks XXXXX to kill his mother, and in return Owen would kill XXXXX's ex-wife. The whole movie was really hilarious.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts of the movie is at the end when XXXX writes "Throw Momma from the Train". XXXXX gets furious because he just wrote a book of similar plot. It turns out that XXXX wrote a children's pop-up book.<br /><br />I would really recommend this movie. I gave it a 10.
