This was a very faithful presentation of XXXXX's life in the mid-50's. The dialogue on theology and the banter with his follow colleagues was exceptionally good. XXXXXXX White's book, "C.S. XXXXX: Creator of Narnia" deals with this time frame in a very parallel way. XXXX Ackland's acting was superb in catching the unemotional Lewis. The movie took great pains to be presented in an accurate English setting. The development of a strong bond between "Jack" (his preferred name) XXXXX and Douglas Gresham, Joy's son from her previous marriage, was enjoyable to watch. The movie did avoid the distasteful element of "Warnie" XXXXX's (Jack's older brother) drinking problem, but it would not have moved the story on, so it is best left out.
