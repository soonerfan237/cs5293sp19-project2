The plot outline of this movie is similar to the original. Someone gets kidnapped, the prince is incest with saving her, XXXX turns into a Swan, the turtle/frog/puffin first the "bad" magician as best they can, and in the end.... Anyways, there is not much new here. With the exception of a lack of well known voice talent. XXXXX, no Palance nor Cleese and thus Jean-Bob was a disapointment.
