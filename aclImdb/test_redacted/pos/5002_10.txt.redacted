"Who do you dream of? XXXX Gibson ... Howdy Doody? I'm talking about the *theater*!" [XXXXX Crystal]<br /><br />Nothing beats a great stage show ... nothing! And XXXXX Crystal lives that belief. A stage actor still waiting for his big break, XXXXX brings the magic of live theater to a small town and to Artie Shoemaker (TOM HULCE) ... a young man who has big dreams (but just didn't know it until he met XXXXX).<br /><br />With scenes and songs from many of America's classic musicals ... Those Lips, Those Eyes conveys both the ups and downs of the people that, for 2 hours, take us to a fantasy land, but who manage to keep that magic alive in their hearts all day long!<br /><br />Like Artie ... once you've seen Those Lips, Those Eyes ... "You're hooked, kid!" [XXXXX Crystal]
