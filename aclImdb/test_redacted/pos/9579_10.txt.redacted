How often do you see a film of any kind that has a talent show with refreshments? XXXXX's Last Stand is a refreshment. Here XXXXX is selling lemonade but isn't making any money. Alfalfa, Spanky, XXXXX, Mickey, and Buckwheat come to visit him which is ironic because in both 3 Men In A Tub and Came The Brawn where there was competition between Alfalfa and Waldo for XXXXX's affection. Back to the story: The Gang taste the lemonade to see if XXXXX made it right. One funny moment is when XXXXXXX gets a glass cup for lemonade and Waldo fills is and gives it to Darla and XXXXXXX has an angry expression on his face. Spanky proposes a floor show to go with the lemonade and even XXXXXX agrees ever so cute. When the floor show begins there is no one at the barn but then a customer comes in (Froggy). Spanky asks him if he wants lemonade but all he does is nod no. Spanky asks him numbers of time in the short and every time XXXXXX nods no Spanky displays many expressions on his face which is funny. Spanky tries many ways to make him thirsty. One way is when after XXXXXX said ever so cutely "Those crackers are salty and they made me thirsty". There is also many entertain musical bit is this short. The opening number is by XXXXX which she tap dances and sings. The second includes XXXXXXX singing off-key (as usually) with Mickey, Leonard, Spanky, and Buckwheat about "How dry I am!" (I believe they sing that to make XXXXXX thirsty. It also made me laugh.). The closing number includes boys and girls all dressed up in an old fashion way. This was XXXXX's last Our Gang short. A grand musical short that is a pure 10 out of 10.
