President XXXXX XX XXXXXX once said that the only thing new in the world is the history you don't know.<br /><br />Seven years before XXXXXXX XXXXXX' superb Pulitzer Prize-winning "The Making of the Atomic Bomb", the BBC produced a seven-part miniseries, "Oppenheimer", that was a character study of the people who designed and built the weapon that ushered in the Atomic Age, permanently joining science and technology to the state (and, in particular, the military), not merely making history, but changing the world forever.<br /><br />The production is impeccable, the casting nothing short of miraculous; not only the main characters, but even secondary characters bear uncanny resemblances to the persons portrayed. In particular are XXX XXXXXXXXX in the title role of American physicist J. XXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX, scientific director of the Manhattan Project, who was based at the Los Alamos, NM, laboratory (the site for which he personally chose); Manning XXXXXXX as General Leslie R. Groves, who oversaw the entire XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX (the project's formal name); XXXXX XXXXXX as physicist, and ultimate nemesis of Oppenheimer, XXXXXX XXXXXX (who, nearly forty years later, whispered into XXXXXX XXXXXX's ear and brought us the Strategic Defense Initiative - "XXXX XXXX") and XXXX XXXXXXX as XXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX. The attention to detail is uniformly excellent throughout.<br /><br />Part thriller, part love story - and ultimately a tragedy, this series faithfully recreates a chapter in world history - and that of science - that we dare not forget. Highest recommendation.<br /><br />(NOTE: Viewers who enjoy this series will also enjoy XXXXX XXXXXXXXX's 13-part series "The Ascent of Man" and the BBC film of XXXXXXX XXXXX's play "Copenhagen".)
