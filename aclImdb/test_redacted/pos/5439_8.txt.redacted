Over the years, I've come to be a fan of director/writer XXXXX XXXXXXXX and he didn't let me down with this very funny look at politics. Popular TV comedian XXX XXXXX(XXXXX XXXXXXXX)has enlightened the nation with his scathing jokes about the state of the country and elected politicians responsible. Night after night, he has his fans rolling in the isles; then the question is proposed that XXXXX run for president himself. His manager XXXX XXXXXX(XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXX)says go for it. Dobb's flippant truisms flames a grass-root movement that puts him on the ballot. Comedian to President-Elect. Meanwhile, a young woman(XXXXX XXXXXX)finds a flaw in the computer system that will count the ballots coast to coast. My favorite sequence is XXXXXX's meltdown in the coffee shop.Williams is absolutely hysterical with his rapid quips. Others of note in the cast: XXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXXX XXXXX and XXXX XXXXXXX.
