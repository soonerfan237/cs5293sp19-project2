Arguably the most disgusting thing to come out of Australia since Vegemite... Predictably distasteful comedy with XXXXX Humphries in a dual role as boozy Australian diplomat Les Patterson and undercover agent Dame Edna! So many bodily function gags that even the Farrelly brothers would have been sick, and several gross-out moments, especially the effects of the horrible H.E.L.P. virus. Only for fans of extreme toilet humor. Oh, and that´s the "NeverEnding Story II", NOT the "XXX Max" George Miller, who directed... *½<br /><br />
