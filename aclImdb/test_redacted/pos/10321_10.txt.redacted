This is the very first Three Stooges short with XXXXX that I saw, and it is one of my favorites! <br /><br />That is what I really liked about Shemp when he returned after XXXXX's stroke, he did not try to be like XXXXX, he was his own character, and that is what I admire! XXXXX is my favorite third stooge, I like him more than Curly, but I like Curly as much as I do XXXXX. Shemp is great, he's funny, he's silly, he's SHEMP! <br /><br />I really loved the scene where he dropped the nickel and XXX got into the booth with him to find it and they ended up getting tangled in the wires and really badly hurt! <br /><br />But what I really thought was scary was when XXXXX had his face smashed against the glass of the phonebooth, he looked like a deformed Professor Snape!<br /><br />Poor XXXXX, he had a lot of bad things happen to him in this short, but that is just typical Three Stooges, they always have a lot of bad things happening to them! <br /><br />This short is another must see for XXXXX Stooges fans! <br /><br />10/10
