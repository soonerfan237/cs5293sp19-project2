Dutiful wife XXXXX Shearer (as Katherine "Kitty" Brown) waits on husband Rod La Rocque (as Bob Brown) hand and foot. While making him breakfast in bed, and helping him dress for a Sunday golf outing, Ms. Shearer suggests joining XXX La Rocque for the day, noting how infrequently the two see each other. But, XX Rocque puts her off, saying her presence adversely affects his game. Then, unexpectedly, XXXXXXX meets the real reason for her husband's frequent absences his pretty blonde mistress!<br /><br />Three years later, XXXXXXX is a glamorous and flirty divorcée. While summering in Paris, she has struck up a friendship with wealthy, older socialite XXXXX Dressler (as as Mrs. "Boucci" Bouccicault). Ms. Dressler invites XXXXXXX to her Long Island home, to socialize with some friends, and ask a favor. Dressler is worried about her granddaughter's relationship with a suave, worldly man. She wants young XXXXX Eilers (as Dionne) to marry Raymond Hackett (as Bruce), instead. Aware of Shearer's flirtatious conquests, XXXXXXXX asks her to lure the undesirable man away from Ms. Eilers. Shearer is stunned to discover the man is XX Rocque, her ex-husband.<br /><br />Shearer and Dressler make this a cute, entertaining play. They are in top form, giving guaranteed-to-be-popular performances, with enthusiasm and professionalism. The story is silly and predictable; yet, in a way which helps the humorous situation. And, the ending is quite clever. In fact, the comic "Let Us be Gay" may have aged better than XXXXXXX's larger-produced, and more serious, "The Divorcée", which was released around the same time. The cast uniformly fine. XX Rocque is better than his film with Lilian Gish; but, his role is not at all endearing. XXXXXXX Emery (as Towney) and Tyrell Davis (as Wallace) are funny supporting suitors.<br /><br />Those not familiar with Norma Shearer may not realize it is she who appears as the dowdy wife in the opening scenes. This is XXXXXXX as "Kitty" before her make-over. Watch the close-ups of Shearer with light, natural make-up, for a good look at an intriguingly beautiful woman.<br /><br />******* Let Us Be Gay (1930) XXXXXX Z.
