Kramer vs. Kramer is the story of a marital breakup and the consequences of same. They can be devastating to the partners and even more so to a minor child which in this case is played by XXXXXX Henry.<br /><br />What I really did like about Kramer vs. Kramer, it's greatest strength as a film is the way that parents Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep are presented to the audience as whole people with many sides to their nature. Though the film is slanted in Hoffman's direction and more about his relationship with his son, he's not presented as any kind of saint, nor is XXXXXX a completely black villain. XXXXXXX's a career oriented man in the advertising game. He's pretty much ignored his wife's dreams and aspirations, still it's a big shock to him when XXXXXX says the love's no longer there and she wants out. She also wants out of being a mother, at least for a while.<br /><br />Hoffman and XXXXX make do the best they can. The pressure of being both parents causes XXXXXXX to lose his job and he has to take a lower paying one in another agency. At that point after over a year, XXXXXX decides she wants custody.<br /><br />Both parents make compelling witnesses and state their case beautifully, but in these situations, the tie is always broken in favor of the mother.<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman and Meryl XXXXXX won their first of two Oscars respectively for this film, her in the Supporting Actress category. I'm not sure how these things are decided, XXXXXX does get less screen time than Hoffman if that's the determining factor. The film does focus on XXXXXXX's relationship with his son and his evolving realization that he has his share of the blame for the marriage failure. As for Meryl it's a Hob's choice for her as it is for many women, to balance a career and motherhood. The conflict in her psyche registers for all to see on the screen.<br /><br />XXXXXX Hoffman may have won that Oscar partly for the same reason that Spencer Tracy picked up his first, by performing the impossible task of not letting a scene stealing child steal the film. Children with their lack of inhibitions are natural actors and XXXXX is great because he comes over as a real kid, not a Hollywood kid. I wonder if XXXXXXX saw Captains Courageous and saw how Spencer Tracy dealt with Freddie Bartholomew. Dustin could have done a lot worse than channel XXXXXXX Tracy in his performance.<br /><br />Kramer vs. Kramer also won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director for Robert Benton and Best Adapted Screenplay. It's an intelligent and compelling drama about adults falling out of love and trying to deal as best they can with it for themselves and their child. Don't miss it if ever broadcast.
