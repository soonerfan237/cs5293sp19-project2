This film centered on a young lady who makes prayers to help her family and friends when they encounter difficulties in life. It made me think of other movies like the "Song of XXXXXXXXXX" and "Francis of Assisi" and has a very strong Catholic faith influence in the film. XXX Blyth is very charming as first, the Catholic school student and then later as a young woman who buys a statue of Saint XXXe (which is the name of the street that I live on, by the way) and makes many prayers for the saint's intercession whenever problems come up in her life. Frances Bavier (Aunt Bea from the XXXX Griffith show) and Edmund Gwenn (from Miracle on 34th Street) play relatives of her. A local priest of mine used to say that my sister resembled XXX Blyth and the both of them have the same first and middle names. A nice good family film that came from an era when life was a bit more simpler.
