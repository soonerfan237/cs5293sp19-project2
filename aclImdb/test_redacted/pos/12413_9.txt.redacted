I know that XXXXX XXXXX usually played lovable old sorts in Westerns. But his role in this segment is something I've remembered for a long time. XXXXX could be a first rate villain. Yes, XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX's XXXX was correct! That look in XXXXXXXXXXX's eye! It expressed porcine greed, ignorance, and the threat of violence all at once. Quite a performance, I think.<br /><br />The segment itself was a good one, too. Question: couldn't the little black bag cure alcoholism? I guess it did, sort of, with XXXX. But the doctor would have been wise to apply the cure, if he had it, as quickly as possible to XXXXXXXXXXX.<br /><br />There is one moment that was annoying but also necessary. And it is something that appears to recur in these Night Gallery segments. It's Serling's constant need to sermonize. For that's what we got, one more time, with Dr. XXXX. I don't know what was more frustrating, losing the black bag and all its miracles or not being to stop XXXX from preaching about the bag's benefit for humanity, all while rubbing XXXXXXXXXXX's greedy face in the mud, and, therefore, all but begging for XXXXXXXXXXX to strike out at him. But as I say, it was necessary. At least it was for me. Otherwise, we wouldn't have been able to see XXXXX' performance discussed above. All done without moving a muscle or speaking a word.
