This movie I've seen many times. I read the book , XXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX which was written by XXXXX XXX XXXXXXXXXXX who received the Scandinavian book awards for the work. The movie does not start on the same place as the book starts. It happens in Reykjavík and the main character, XXXX is young and having a good life with his girlfriend. But as she breaks up the relationship with him, he starts to get some headaches which make him annoyed and angry. And soon he starts to have big mental problems and then the movie begins. Soon he is puted in the Icelandic Mental Hospital called "Kleppur" and there you get to see some great characters like XXXXXX who thinks he is XXXXXX and Óli who thinks that he writes all the " The Beatles" songs and sends them to them with mind transporting. XXXXXX E Sigurðusson who has the role of the main character XXXX does is so work so well that it leaves you breathless. Also the music in this movie is mad by SIGURRÓS and just for the music's cost you should see the movie. Overall a great movie meant to be seen.
