Choose your fate: The terrible tykes of the fourth form, playing practical jokes that involve axes, or the...ummm...well-developed girls of the sixth form, who discovered some time ago cigarettes, gin, sex and how easily men can be led astray. The problem is that one set comes with the other. They are all there at XXX XXXXXXX's, that remarkably easy-going English school for girls led by headmistress XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXX (Alastair XXX). As XXXX XXXXXXX is fond of pointing out, "In other schools girls are sent out quite unprepared into a merciless world, but when our girls leave here, it is the merciless world which has to be prepared." XXXX XXXXXXX sounds something like a melding of XXXXX XXXXX and XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX, and definitely has XXX's droll and deadpan comic genes. <br /><br />In The Belles of XXX XXXXXXX's, a sly, chaotic comedy from the team of XXXXX XXXXXXX and XXXXXX XXXXXXX, XXX XXXXXXX's is, as usual, on the brink of financial disaster. Salvation may be at hand, however, when a rich sheik sends his daughter to join the fourth form and receive a proper English education. The sheik also is a horse owner and one of his prize racers, XXXX XXX, is being trained near the school for a race. It's only a matter of time before the fourth- form girls form a racing pool and bet heavily on XXXX XXX, with XXXX XXXXXXX adding to the pool what funds the school has left. (Much of the fourth-form girl's money comes from the gin they make in chemistry, then bottle and lower by rope to XXXXX XXXXX (XXXXXX XXXX), a Cockney fixer, for distribution. "It's got something...I don't know quite what," says XXXX XXXXXXX on sampling the stuff, "but send a few bottles up to my room.") <br /><br />XXXX XXXXXXX, however, has a brother, Clarence XXXXXXX (who, by some coincidence of casting, also is Alastair XXX), a bookmaker who not only has placed a bundle on another horse, but who also has a daughter. And he has placed the precocious XXXXXXXX in the sixth form to keep him informed. Soon the sixth form has kidnapped XXXX XXX, the fourth form has taken the horse back, XXXXX XXXXX has joined forces with XXXX XXXXXXX, the sixth-form girls are determined that XXXX XXX will not leave the second floor of XXX XXXXXXX's, Clarence and his Homburg-wearing gang have arrived, parents are driving up for Parent's Day and the Ministry of Education has arrived in the person of a very proper inspector. Total war breaks out at XXX XXXXXXX's. It's hard to say which is more dangerous, the African spears or the flour bombs. <br /><br />Alastair XXX as XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXX turns in a tour de force performance. XXXX XXXXXXX is a tall woman with a stately bosom, fond of long gowns with embroidered lace and Edwardian hats with lots of feathers. She takes everything in stride, even a fourth-former pounding at something in chemistry class and, after hearing an explosion a few minutes later, the results. "Oh dear. I told XXXXXX to be careful with that nitro-glycerine!" She is firm in believing that XXX XXXXXXX's is "a gay arcadia of happy girls." XXX was one of Britain's great eccentric actors. Other than the sheer chaos of all the little (and not so little) girls doing terrible things, he delivers much of the film's pleasure.
