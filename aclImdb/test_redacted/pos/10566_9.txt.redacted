BBC's 3 hour adaptation of the novel by XXXXX XXXXXX..."Fingersmith". Life is tough without money, especially in Dickensian London. Dark deeds lead to despicable dilemmas.Is love really just a luxury for the rich and free ?? XXXXXX Cassidy as "XXXX XXXXX" and XXXXX XXXXXXX as "XXX XXXXXXX" both give fantastic performances as the leading ladies asking this question ... OF EACH OTHER ...whilst XXXXXX XXXXX shines as the delightfully bad "Gentleman".. with great support from XXXXXX XXXXXXXX's "Mrs Sucksby", XXXXX XXXXXXXXX's "Mr Ibbs" and XXXXXXX XXXXX's "Uncle". The plot twists and turns and I wasn't sure I could be led to care about characters able to hurt and use each other in this way... but somehow.. i do care... and thats because of the quality of the performances... love feels like love .. hate feels like hate... betrayal .. confusion.. well hopefully you get the idea and hopefully you will get the DVD and enjoy.( XXXXXX Cassidy is just great in this.. gorgeous in fact.... i have to declare i am in her fan club... Hi XXXXXX : )
