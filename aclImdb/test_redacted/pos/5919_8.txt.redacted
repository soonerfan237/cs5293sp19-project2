This film recreates XXXXXXXXX's historic flight across the Atlantic while touching on episodes in his aviation career through flashbacks. XXXXXXX was about 20 years too old to be playing the young flier, but his fine performance, particularly in the solo flight sequences, makes this a minor quibble. XXXXXX's rousing score is a big plus. Despite the long running time, XXXXXX manages to make it quite exciting and is able to sustain the drama even though the outcome is known. What a year 1957 was for XXXXXX: besides this, he also wrote and directed "Love in the Afternoon" and "Witness for the Prosecution." And his next two were "Some Like it Hot" and "The Apartment." What a run!
