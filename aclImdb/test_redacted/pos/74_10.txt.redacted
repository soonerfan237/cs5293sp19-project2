Darling XXXX is fantastic! Its by far one my favorite films! It certainly didn't deserve the poor reviews it received. XXXXX Andrews, playing the title role of Lili Smith (Schmidt) is the best part of the whole movie. She is entrancing and spectacular! As XXXXX Andrews is my most favorite actress and singer by far, I was most definatly not surprised by how stunning she is. This movie is just...great (I'm running out of adjectives!), it's magnificent, marvellous, amazing, funny, terribly romantic, sad, and just an all-out thrill and its all thanks to XXXX Julie Andrews!And to her husband, director Blake Edwards. Oh, yeah XXXX Hudson was ok, too :)<br /><br />Julie Andrews is the beautiful and well-loved singer, Lili Smith. XXXX Hudson portrays Major Larabee, who quickly falls for Lili, and she with him. But their affair was not coincedental. There meeting was planned by the German Government (I'm not sure if that's exactly what you'd call them, but you get the point), because the warm, happy, singing entertainer XXXX is actually a German Spy. Lili is told to seduce XXXXX LArabee in order to get information of the new Top Secret Opertaion (later know as "Crepe Suzette"). Though XXXX is on a solemn mission, she falls in love with Bill (Major Larabee), for real, making her original quest challenging. But XXXX pulls through and completes er task, after she finds out something that is not really true about Bill. The ending will remain unsaid by me as it is wonderfully layed out. If anything, you'll thoroughly enjoy this movie, I most certainly did!!!!!!!!<br /><br />
