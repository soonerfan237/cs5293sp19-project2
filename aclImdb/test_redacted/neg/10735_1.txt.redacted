I can get over the political parody; even if this was SUPPOSE to be a "Masters of Horror" flick.<br /><br />But, what I can't get over is the blatant usage of our war heroes (and their sacrifice) as pawns in some washed up horror maker's political statement.<br /><br />To me it was purely insulting to desecrate XXXXXXXXX, and our heroes. I have family at Arlington. The idea that this guy (XXXXX) would even portray the Arlington graves being disturbed just makes me want to puke.<br /><br />I'm done with XXXXX, and done with MOH.
