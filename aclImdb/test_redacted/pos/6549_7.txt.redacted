Watched XXXXXXX last night and right away was reminded of two early XXXXX XXXX films from Australia, The Last Wave and XXXXXX At Hanging XXXX. They were films loaded with atmosphere but short on actual horror. XXXXXXX, to me, seems clearly influenced by these films. It has a number of fairly mundane scenes that become more portentous the deeper you are sucked in by the film. It also has more scenes of outright horror and although I don't think the film actually measures up to those two films it is well worth the time of most thoughtful fans of the unusual (not necessarily horror). 7 out of 10 seems fair but I must say that years after seeing The Last Wave the film still stays with me, and it is precisely XXXXXX At Hanging XXXX's unresolved ending that makes it so haunting. p.s. All the people criticizing the acting... pullleasse...in this genre?
