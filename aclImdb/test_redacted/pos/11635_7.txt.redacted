Mighty Like A Moose is one of many short films XXXXXXXX Leo McCarey did starring Charley Chase. What a dandy it is! XXXXXXX and his wife both undergo plastic surgery to improve their hideous appearances unbeknown-est to each other. They then meet at a party and become smitten with each other. Now they can't allow each other to find out they're cheating. That's the preposterous premise of this frantic farce. XXXXXX Oakland, one of the few comic short leads to have a flourishing career long after the silents, is perfect as Charley's long of nose wife. XXXXXXX has an awful case of buck teeth, which are quickly dispatched at the dentist's. After a party is raided by police for no other reason then to practice raids, XXXXXXX and his wife frantically try avoiding each other at home for fear the alterations in appearances become known. Both have been photographed with their new features at the party. The hilarity back home culminates in Charley trying to teach the no-good-nick cheating with his wife a lesson. The no-good-nick of course is the new XXXXXXX, which his wife comes to realize long before XXXXXXX teaches a lesson in faithfulness. This is one of XXXXXXX Chase's better efforts. *** of 4 stars.
