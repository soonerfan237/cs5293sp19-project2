In Russia, the ordinary teenager XXXX (XXXXXXX XXXXXX) lives a leisured life with her drunkard father and her simpleton mother, without working and waiting for the calling for a technical course of telephone operator. Her brother XXXXXX (XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXX) lives in Moscow with the family of his own and occasionally visits his dysfunctional family and XXXX, being always motive for arguing. When XXXX meets the student of university Sergei (XXXXXX XXXXXXX), they fall in love for each other and decide to get married. Sergei moves to XXXX's house, but lives in conflict with her father. This relationship leads the family to a tragedy.<br /><br />I have just seen "Malenkaya XXXX", and I liked a lot this deep family drama. I am not familiarized with the life style in the former URSS, but there are some unusual behaviors that I found very interesting. The first one, when XXXXXX tells XXXX that she was conceived not because her parents wanted to have her, but because they wanted to move to a larger apartment. Another one, when the family goes to the beach in a truck. Many difficulties of XXXX's family and their friends, the repression in the park and other situations pictured in the movie are common in Third World countries. This low budget movie is very well-directed, and the story is very profound and real. The cast has great performances and the actress XXXXXXX XXXXXX is very beautiful. In the cover of the Brazilian VHS, released by XXXXXX distributor, there is information that XXXXXXX XXXXXX was the centerfold of Playboy magazine. I am not sure how precise are the subtitles in Portuguese, since many long sentences spoken in Russian are limited to short translation in few words. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "A Pequena XXXX" ("The Little XXXX")
