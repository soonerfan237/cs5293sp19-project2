Dear Readers, 2001: A Space Odyssey is XXXXXXX at his best...although I really can't say that as Space Odyssey is his only film I've ever watched. But still, it's a good film. Strange, but good.<br /><br />The movie is in three acts, much like the novel...which is unsurprising since the author wrote the screenplay. Anyhow, we first start out with the simple yet spectacular opening with Also XXXXXXX Zarathustra blaring on the speakers. Then comes the boring beyond belief 'Dawn of XXX' sequence. Then there's the odd 'Finding of the Monolith' sequence on the Moon, played to XXXXXXX's Blue Danube. Finally things get good with the Spaceship scenes and HAL going berserk and killing people. After that things die down and we have the 'Entering the Monolith' sequence which was WAY too long and the ultra-strange ending. Even though, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a good film. It's not XXXX Wars, XXXXgate, Terminator, or The Abyss, but it rocks. My compliments to the chef, XXX Kubrick.<br /><br />Signed, The Constant DVD Collector
