The genius that is XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX was never more prominently displayed as it was in his 1979 "Musical Thriller" SWEENEY TODD, a Gothic, gory, grisly, yet delicious musical concoction about a demented barber who returns to London to exact revenge on the evil Judge who not only had him permanently exiled from London, but who is also raising his daughter as his own and plans to marry her to "shield her from all the evils of the world." The barber finds love,sympathy, and assistance from a lonely pie shop owner who has her own agenda where XXXX is concerned. This musical rocked XXXXXXXX and won nine Tony Awards, including XXXX XXXXXXX and XXXX XXXXXXX in a Musical (XXXXXX XXXXXXXX). The production was filmed in its entirety in 1982 with XXXXXX XXXXXXXX recreating her XXXXXXXX role as Mrs. XXXXXX, the daffy pie shop owner who finds a practical use for the heads that XXXX makes mincemeat out of. XXXXXX Hearn, who replaced XXX XXXXXX on XXXXXXXX, is electrifying in the title role, so much so that you have to wonder why he wasn't originally cast in the role. Lansbury and Hearn are riveting from start to finish and commit 100% to their ghoulish characters aided, by a first rate XXXXXXXXX score, probably the closest thing XXXXXXXX has written to an opera. Lansbury shines on "The Worst Pies in London" and "By the Sea". XXXXXX Hearn stops the show with "Epiphany" and is also compelling during "Pretty Women", a duet he sings with Judge XXXXXX, the man he has sworn revenge on. XXXX XXXXXXXXX is vocally impressive as XXXXXX, the young sailer who rescues XXXX and falls for his daughter XXXXXXX. XXXXX Joselyn is a little over the top as XXXXXXX and really pushes vocally to the point that during "XXXXX XXXXX and XXXXXX XXXX" she actually drives her voice off-pitch during a couple of moments. The rest of the cast is first rate, especially XXXXXX XXXXXXX as Judge XXXXXX who gets to perform "XXXXXXX" in this production, which was cut from the original production and XXX XXXXXXXX as XXXX, whose gorgeous tenor fills the auditorium on "Not While I'm Around." But it is breathtaking musical score by XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX and the mesmerizing performance by Lansbury an especially XXXXXX Hearn that makes this night of Gothic musical theater an experience that stays with you long after curtain call. Not for all tastes, but if you're game and have strong heart, SWEENEY TODD is a joy for all music theater lovers and a must for fans of XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX and XXXXXX XXXXXXXX.
