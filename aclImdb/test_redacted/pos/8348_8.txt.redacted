I loved this film almost as much as the origional version!What teenager DOESN'T go through what XXXXX's going through;wanting to find independence by getting more and more distant from your family?The songs were nice to,and the character designs were great.XXXX and XXXXX look almost exactly like they did in the origional feature.They did a good job on the voices of those two,too considering the fact that the origional voice actors are probably dead.However,I do think they should've given more lines to XXXX,XXXXXXX,Colette,and Daniel.Oh well;at least they had the common sense to keep the same scenery from the original film.
