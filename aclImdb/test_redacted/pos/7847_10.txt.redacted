During the Civil war a wounded union soldier hides out in a isolated Confederate ladies' school; where the head mistress and the teacher of the school decide to care for him and keep him about, until trouble starts brewing between the lonely and sexually frustrated women and girls. The soldier decides to take advantage of this situation, but it all comes at a price in the end. <br /><br />"XXXXX XXXXX (1971)" (which was made about the same time of "The Beguiled") might be my favourite collaboration between XXXXXXXX and XXXXXX, but after seeing this, I tend to think this to be the pairs' finest work together. A very atypical, savvy and stylish vehicle for XXXXXXXX is always on the mark with richly controlled direction by XXX XXXXXX and a hauntingly rousing music score by XXXX XXXXXXXX. Standing out strongly is its sultrily lurid and bleak nature that's intrusively planted into the film's psychological makeup and manipulative strangle hold in sexual depravity. It's assiduously played out and makes it more the brooding and blood curdling when those random shocks and saucy intentions take hold with gripping tension. The way XXXXXX illustrates XXXX X XXXXXX and XXXXXX XXXXX's alluring bold, slow-burn screenplay (taken from the novel of XXXXXX XXXXXXXX) is effectively done through stark emotions and the script's tight, lyrical context. XXXXXX's strong direction captures the idyllically southern Victorian setting with such potently garnished photography and he sets up some strangely piercing imagery with great clarity and restrained. <br /><br />While the performances, are truly commendable and high of quality. XXXXX XXXXXXXX as the smoothly suave, sweet talking chameleon union soldier is very impressionable and delightfully assured. A profoundly eminent XXXXXXXXX XXXX steals the picture as the hardened head mistress and the elegant XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXX adds a delicate sincereness to her innocent character. XXX Mercer is strongly tailored as the black maid and XX XXX XXXXXX is the pick of the crop from the young pupils with her seductively sly persona. <br /><br />Honestly while XXXXXXXX's charismatic character plays the field for his own selfish needs, there's still mixed intentions there that the one's being played (where rivalry between the women creep in) turn out to be no better than their guest at the end. Throughout there's a perversely dark sense of humour and ironic touch settling into the material. What's demonstrated here, is simply more than your basic little minded shocker, but one that's thickly layered with intrigue and a sense of realism that's hard to shake. That also goes for its extremely eerie title and closing song. <br /><br />A effectively chilling, low-key item that's hard not to be tempted by it's swinging hospitality.
