This is the best version of Gypsy that has been filmed.Bette XXXXXX is simply superb as XXXX XXXXXXXX has the voice,the gestures,the look,and most of all,a supreme acting ability to carry the role off and to make her character come alive.Her singing is,simply put:MAGNIFICENT! She especially shines in two numbers-"Everything's Coming Up XXXXs" and "XXXX's Turn". The other actors are also fine,particularly XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX as Tessie.Also good is XXXXX XXXXXXX;his portrayal of XXXXXX is acted with great style and believability.The direction of this movie is very,very good.There isn't a false note or gaffe in the entire production.This film is a vast improvement over the Roz Russell version filmed in 1962.Since viewing it again,I can state that the three greatest Mama XXXXs are:XXXXX XXXXXX,Bette XXXXXX,and XXXXXX XXXXXXXX. See this movie.You'll be glad that you did.
