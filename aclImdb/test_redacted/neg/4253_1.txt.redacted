I don't see why everyone loves this film so much. True, it does have good intentions and meaning, but you cannot compensate for such a poor script. XXXXX Allen is a brilliant filmaker, but I'm afraid this is just a piece of garbage. It's extremely predictable and the subject matter is all too visible. I happen to be a huge Woody XXXXX fan and love most of his work, but this I cannot recomend.
