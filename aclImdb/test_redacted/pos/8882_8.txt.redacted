This movie is basically a spoof on XXXXXXXXX's Strangers on a train, which i thought was overrated anyway. The plot has XXXXX Devito going to see Strangers and then thinking Billy Crystal wants them to swap murders, For Crystal to murder his mother and Devito to murder his wife. Both XXXXXX and Crystal are great and so is XXXXXX's mother. This is XXXXXX's directorial debut and it's better than the war of the roses.
