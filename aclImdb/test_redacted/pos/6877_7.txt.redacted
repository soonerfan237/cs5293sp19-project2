I remember seeing this 1978 comedy at one of the bargain matinees I took in when I was looking for a study break from my college courses. XXXXXX Matthau and XXXXXX XXXXXXX do some effective Tracy-Hepburn-style thrusting-and-parrying in this featherweight romp directed by the reliable XXXXXX XXXXX (he did "Private XXXXXXXX") about a newly widowed doctor's aggressive re-entry into the dating game. It all breezes by quickly primarily thanks to the clever script by veteran screenwriter XXXXXX XX XXXXXXX ("Casablanca") along with XXXX XXXXXX, XXX XXXXXXX and future director XXXXXXX Shyer.<br /><br />Dr. XXXXXXX XXXXXXX has just come back from Hawaii after his wife's death. Upon his return, he becomes aware that he is instant catnip to any and all the single women in LA. He works in a hospital run by an increasingly senile chief-of-staff, XXXX XXXXXXXXXX, whom XXXXXXX has to pacify to keep his residency. XXXXX XXX XXXXXXXX, a transplanted Englishwoman who bakes cheesecakes for a living and has certain concrete opinions about the medical profession, which she expresses freely on a PBS talk show. Of course, XXXXXXX is on the show's discussion panel, and sparks, as they say, fly. This leads to the standard complications about how serious XXXXXXX is willing to become about XXX. At the same time, the hospital has to deal with a potential wrongful death lawsuit from the widow of a rich baseball team owner who died at the hospital under XXXXXXXXXX's careless supervision.<br /><br />It's just refreshing to see such a mature yet bracing love story between two characters inhabited by actors who deliver lines with the scalpel-wielding skill of surgeons. Matthau is his usual 1970's curmudgeonly swinger and quite a sight waddling with his gangly arms held akimbo in his power walk. Away from her heavy, award-winning Elizabethan roles, XXXXXXX is crisply sardonic and charmingly vulnerable as the feisty XXX, who thinks all doctors should aspire to be XXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX. XXX XXXXXX plays XXXXXXXXXX with predictable bluster, while Richard XXXXXXXX provides amiable support as XXXXXXX's colleague, Dr. Solomon. It's all very compact with a few nice jabs at the greed within the medical profession. There are no extras on the 2005 DVD.
