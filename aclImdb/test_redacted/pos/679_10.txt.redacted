Whenever XXX XXXXXX appeared or directed a film in the 30's,40's and 50's, you were guaranteed great entertainment even if the picture was black and white. XXX was able to capture audiences and keep them spellbound until the very end of her pictures. In this film as Mrs. XXXXX XXXXXX,"High Sierra",'41 along with XXXXXX XXXX,(XXXXXX XXXXXX),"XXXXXX XXXXXX",'40 she keeps you guessing just how the relationship is going to turn out and just how poor Mrs. XXXXXX will be able to have a normal and happy marriage with love and real affection. If you liked XXX XXXXXX, who could play the roles as a criminal in a woman's prison and prison warden who was hated, this is the film for you to enjoy. I truly believe that XXX XXXXXX was not given the true credit she deserved for her great talents in the Movie Industry!!!
