I'm not sure why I picked for a borrow from mom for "XXXXX Betty". I think just because I had heard a little bit of this movie. But I'm glad I did. "XXXXX Betty" is an original and clever movie that has humor and a darker side. <br /><br />This was one of XXXXX's first big one's before hitting it major in Hollywood. I can see why, she is an incredible actress. The scene where she finally realizes what had happened and she's on the set of her favorite soap opera, you can see pain, confusion, fear, and embarrassment on her face. Just to let you in on the movie, she plays XXXXX. A shy and insecure woman who stands by her abusive husband, she's a waitress, and is in love with soap operas, especially one where a certain cute doctor, Dr. XXXX Revell. When she happens to see her husband's murder accidentally in separate room, the murders she notices are two customers she just had, XXXXXX Freeman and Chris Rock. She then just looses her mind and leaves town after talking to he police and says she needs to find her former fianc√©e, Dr. XXXX Revell. So, she travels along the country to California to find Dr. Revell, and wants a job as a nurse to work with XXXX, she's seen the show so many times, somehow she's just awesome at being a nurse when she saves a woman's brother. Despite everyone telling her that she is delusional, she just looks at them like as if they were the crazy one's. When she meets the actor who plays XXXX Revell, George(his real name) thinks she's just a crazy fan trying to get on the show. She just looks at him with confusion and believes that he and her belong together.<br /><br />XXXXX was terrific, she was so believable on loosing her mind in the movie. She has come such a long way, and wither you want to admit it or not, she's adorable and a great actress.<br /><br />Morgan XXXXXXX plays one of the assassin's, Charlie, who is the father of the two. He is so charmed and smittened by XXXXX and while chasing her around the country, he becomes almost just infatuated with XXXXX to the point where he almost falls in love with her. He and his son XXXXXX must find Betty when they find out she was there at the murder scene and could give away their identities. When XXXXXXX sees Betty and catches her finally, she's scarred at first, but calms down and they know they have a real connection. It was a beautifully played scene, my opinion is that XXXXXX gave a stronger performance. He's just great.<br /><br />A surprisingly decent performance by XXXXX Rock, the son, Wesley. He is so "gun"-ho about just getting the job done in a rush and taking care of business. I loved his comedic performance at the end where he and the gang he's holding hostage by gun point are just watching the soap opera's together. Classic. "XXXXX Betty" is a great movie that I'd recommend for a good laugh and just in all a nice honest little movie I think anyone could enjoy.<br /><br />9/10
