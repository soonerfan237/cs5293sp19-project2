XXXXX XXXXX was not the first person to realise that zombies can run like the clappers. That honour belongs to Lifeforce, which is, of course, the greatest naked space vampire zombies from Halley's Comet running amok in London end-of-the-world movie ever made. XXXX XXXXXX may have made a lot of crap, but for this deliriously demented epic sci-fi horror he deserves a place among the immortals. Plus it offers space vampire XXXXXXXX XXX, the best thing to come out of France since XXXXXX XXXXX, spending the entire movie naked. Which she does very, very well. Just bear in mind that while she is the most overwhelmingly feminine presence anyone on XXXXX has ever encountered, she's also "totally alien to this planet and our life form and totally dangerous." It's a pitch meeting I'd have loved to have sat in on: Astronauts from the British space program find three naked humanoid alien life forms inside a giant 150-mile long artichoke/umbrella shaped spaceship hidden in the tail of Halley's Comet filled with giant desiccated bats and bring them back to XXXXX with near apocalyptic results as they proceed to drain the population of London of their lifeforce amid much nudity, whirlpools of thunder and spit your coffee across the room direlogue ("I've been in space for six months, and she looks perfect to me." "Assume we know nothing, which is understating the matter." "Don't worry, a naked woman is not going to get out of this complex."). Oh, and we'll get the writers of Alien and XXXX XXXXXXX to write it with uncredited rewrites by the writer of XXXX of the Devil, The Sex Thief and XXXXXX XXXX and the director of The Jonestown Monster. Sounds like a winner, here's $22m  have fun. And they do, they do.<br /><br />True, there's enough promise in the raw material to have made something genuinely creepy and thought-provoking (at a time when AIDS hysteria was approaching its height, a sexually transmitted 'plague' offers ample opportunity for allegory), but in the hands of the Go-Go boys at Cannon, what could have been another Quatermass and the Pit quickly turns instead to be more Plan 10 From XXXXX XXXXX. It's full-to-bursting with delirious inanity, be it XXXXX XXXXXX's hilarious death scene ("Here I go!"), XXXXX XXXXX's grand entrance ("I'm Colonel Caine." "From the SAS?" discreetly shouts XXXXXXX XXXXXXX across a room full of reporters: "Gentlemen, that last remark was not for publication. This is a D-Notice situation" he replies to the surprisingly obliging pressmen), the security guards offering XXXXXXXX XXX's naked space vampire a nice biscuit to stop her escaping, reanimated bodies exploding into dust all over people, the sweaty Prime Minister sucking the life out of his secretary and London filling up with zombie nuns, stockbrokers and joggers as the city gets its most comprehensive on screen trashing since Mrs XXXXX lost junior at Battersea Funfair and went on the rampage. And that's not mentioning the "This woman is a masochist! An extreme masochist!" scene or the great stereophonic echo effect on the male vampire's "It'll be a lot less terrifying if you just come to me" line while a lead-stake wielding XXXXX XXXXX adopts his best Action Man voice to reply "I'll do just that!" In one scene alone you have a possessed XXXXXXX XXXXXXX embodying the female in our deeply confused astronaut hero's mind, XXXXX "I-never-got-over-playing-Charlie-Manson" Railsback and his amazing dancing eyebrows in full-on "Helta-Skelta!" mode trying to resist the temptation to kiss him, the inimitable XXXXXX XXXXXX (the only man who makes XXXXXXX XXXXX look restrained) playing the Home Secretary XXX XXXXX XXXXXXXXX as a kind of demented XXXXX XXX, XXXXX XXXXX (one of those actors who always looks like he must have been a Doctor Who around the time no-one was watching it anymore) hamming up the blasé public school macho in the hope that no-one will ever see it and the peerless reaction shots of XXXX XXXXXX as the male nurse who keeps on opening the door mid-psychic-tornado to bring in more drugs. As if they needed any more in this film. It's just a shame that XXXXX XXXXXX's mad-haired scientist who isn't qualified to certify death on alien life forms (a role originally intended for XXXXX XXXXXX) missed out on the action in that one.<br /><br />No matter how mad you think the film is, it still manages to get madder still, whether it be a zombie pathologist ("He too needs feeding") exploding all over the Home secretary's suit, XXXXXXX XXXXXXX's blood and entrails forming a naked XXXXXXXX XXX or the space vampires turning XX XXXX's Cathedral into the world's biggest laser-show to transport human souls from the London Underground to their geostationary mother ship. I loved every gloriously insane moment. In it's own truly unique way, this might be the greatest film ever made.<br /><br />The DVD offers the original 116-minute version that opened in the UK rather than the heavily edited 101-minute US version, which not only offers much more hilarity for your dollar, but also fully restores XXXXX XXXXXXX's score to its original glory (the US version covered a lot of the gaps with additional cues by XXXXXXX XXXXX and XXXXX XXXXXXX). Although a somewhat surprising choice at first sight, XXXXXXX cut his teeth on many of the classic Universal sci-fi horrors of the 50s and his score is quite superb, with a terrific driving main title that offers a rare reminder of just how interesting he could be away from XXXXX XXXXXXX. Sadly there's no more than a trailer by way of extras, though it would be nice to hope some day for a special edition with some of the deleted scenes from XXXXXX's originally intended 128-minute cut: from what's on display here, these might just offer even more comedy gold!
