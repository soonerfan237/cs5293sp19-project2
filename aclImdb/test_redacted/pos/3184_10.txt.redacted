there's only so much that i can take of Filipino films, especially nowadays where the trend is sex, action and slapstick comedy(which i hate). the fact that XXXXXX XX XXX made me think and made me gape during the movie was a big plus. It's got good cinematic scenes and editing was great, especially the cinematography. i think that XXXXXXXX deserves the best actress here rather than getting one in the movie XXXXX. the fact that there's only so few Filipino movies that i really like. i think XXXXX XXXXXX did such a great job in this movie. i truly truly loved this movie, technically and character development wise; the plot was complex and that's what made it terrific.
