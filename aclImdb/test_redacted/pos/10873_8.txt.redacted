XXXXXX Vickers (Nell Schofield) and Sue Knight (Jad Capelja) want to become one of the cool girls in their high school. Uncool and ugly girls had two options, be a mole or a prude! XXXXXX and Sue imitate them by using their cheating practices in an exam. Two of the cool boys, XXXXX (Goeff Rhoe) and Danny (Tony Hughes) ask them for their answers and they all get busted. After a bawling out from the headmaster (Bud Tingwell) the cool girls meet them outside in the playground and confronted them about whether they "dobbed" on them all. As XXXXXX and Sue hadn't the cool girls invited them to the "dunnies" for a smoke. They then start to hang with them on weekends at the beach, watching all the boys surf. Sue ends up going out with XXXXX and Debbie with Garry. A lot of usual teenage action takes place including sex, drugs and rock and roll. XXXXX has an eventual overdose of heroin which makes Debbie face the inequalities of life and she decides to learn to surf instead of just watching the boys. They are not happy but watch her, calling names, and eventually XXXXXX masters the board. A cool early 80s Aussie film.
