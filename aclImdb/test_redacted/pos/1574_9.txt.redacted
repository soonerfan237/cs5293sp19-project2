Until I did a Web search on "What XXXXX Found", I didn't realize that the name of the film is embedded in the title of one of XXXXX XXXXXXX's books. The book's complete title is "Through the Looking-Glass (And What XXXXX Found There)".<br /><br />The XXXXX of the film comes from a background quite different from that of XXXXX XXXXXXX's XXXXX. Her fresh and assertive character, however, is similar. The movie XXXXX begins as a young woman in New Hampshire who steals money from her ass-patting boss and takes off for XXXXX, vaguely planning to study marine biology and play with dolphins. She encounters a middle-aged couple in a motor home (the husband's retired from the military) who rescue her from a strange man at a roadside stop and from her car's breakdown (perhaps caused by their mechanizations).<br /><br />As it turns out, the couple is heavily involved in truck stop prostitution and see sweet, young XXXXX as a promising recruit. The wife (played by XXXXXX XXXX in a performance worthy of some big award) buys XXXXX sexy clothing and shows her how to apply hot makeup. Initially, XXXXX passively accepts her ministrations and, with the couple's instructions, does several tricks. The encounter shown in the most detail is quite different from most cinematic sex but may be typical of what most often happens in real life. The man is shy and deferential and apologizes for "finishing" too fast.<br /><br />What's wonderful about XXXXX (and different from her prototypes from Clarissa to XXXXXX XXXXXX) is that she learns from her experiences and asserts herself. This is how things really are. Prostitution is everywhere. People are neither all good or all bad. XXXXX leaves the motor home with her well-earned money and a feeling of mutual respect.
