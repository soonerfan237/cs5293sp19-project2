directed by albert pyun in his inimitably awful but strangely hypnotic style, "crazy six" is yet another jewel in the crown for this decade's upscale hugo haas (jess franco?). "Stylish" overdirection, incoherent plotting, time-outs in the middle of action sequences for eurodisco torch -song performances, all these seem to be signifying traits for our man XXXX. Most interesting is how he always gets top-notch b-movie casts, compared to XXXXXXXX or some of the other video directors. Ice-T, XXX Lowe, Mario Van Peebles, & the very strange Burt Reynolds ain't a bad cast, though they often look a bit confused. Check out "Postmortem", "Mean Guns", & "XXXXX Doom" for more top-notch Pyun mayhem!
