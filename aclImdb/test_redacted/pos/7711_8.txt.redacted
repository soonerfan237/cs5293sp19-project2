This is the fifth part of 'The XXXXXXXXX', a collection of animated short movies that tell us a little more about the world of 'The XXXXXX'. This time they introduce Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) in a story about a detective who is hired to find her. With great black and white animation and an interesting story this is again a great animated short from 'The XXXXXXXXX'.
