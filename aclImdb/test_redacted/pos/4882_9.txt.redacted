Finally!!! A good movie made on the most demented serial killer in history. For those less familiar with XX XXXX, he was basically the madman who was known for grave robbing and skinning his victims (which most horror fans ripped off). Shot in a period style that reflects the bleak plains of Wisconsin perfectly, this is easily the most atmospheric horror film yet to depict XXXX and his gruesome killings. XXXX Hodder (XXXXX from Friday the 13th series) and XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX (XXXXX have Eyes I & II), deliver chilling performances in this serial killer opus that easily leaves behind the lackluster former XXXX attempts. So far I'd say this is one of the better horror films released this year (Turistas = 0).
