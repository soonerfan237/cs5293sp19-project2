From start to finish, this 1926 classic two reeler from the Hal XXXXX Studios seems to sum up what was fun about the 20's. It stars the now forgotten comic genius, XXXXXXX XXXXX and was directed by the legendary XXX XXXXXXX, who was unknown then but would earn his keep with XXXXX and graduate to greener pastures in the 30's and 40's. Recently released onto video and disc, this is one of the ten best examples of silent screen comedy and should be seen by audiences of all ages. Although today his star has virtually diminished, XXXXXXX XXXXX was considered the leader in the short subject comedy field in the waning years of the silents. He helped the careers of XXXX XXXXXX and XXXXXX XXXXX before they were brought together as a team, XXX XXXXXXX and a host of other talents. It is a shame that he is all but remembered today. Check out this little gem of a film. Once you do, you will be seeking out other films from this classic comic. He had his hand in over 300 films and many of them survive. Rediscover this lost giant of a film from a bygone era and its giant star.
