XXXXXXXXX XXXXX was not the first cartoon to feature XXXXXX XXXXX. The first film to star America's friend was "XXXXX XXXXX". "XXXXX XXXXX" was released May 15th 1928 in Hollywood California,in the silent movie format. "XXXXXXXXX XXXXX" was released November 18th 1928 as a SOUND movie (it was also released July 29th 1928 as a silent film). Thus making "XXXXXXXXX.."the first SOUND film of Mickey but NOT the first film for the little American Mouse. While many game shows have used the question: "What was the first appearance of XXXXXX XXXXX?" The true answer is "XXXXX XXXXX" not "XXXXXXXXX XXXXX".
