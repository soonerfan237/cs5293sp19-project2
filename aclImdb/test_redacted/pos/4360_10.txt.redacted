Wow.this is a touching story! First i saw 'Rescue Dawn'.I didn't 'like' it. And now i have seen the person , XXXXXX XXXXXXX , about whom this story is being told by XXXXXX.Very Impressing.XXXXXX is a driven human being who encountered the most opposite emotions in his live on this earth.what an extraordinary life this person has led. His tale about the capture by the Patet Lao/Vietcong and thus his suffering is horrifying but what's most impressive is his incredible will to survive.How could he find the strenght ? In a haunting way , XXXXXX is telling us in full flowing sentences about his terrible ordeal during his captivity... he is a great storyteller and XXXXXX does him the justice this brave man deserves.<br /><br />In my opinion.'Little XXXXXX needs to fly ' tells it all ! , leaving nothing to the imagination , thus making ' Rescue dawn ' a superfluous film. The horror doesn't get more real than in the words of XXXXXX XXXXXXX himself.He totally succeeds in painting the picture.
