XXXX Spoilers<br /><br />....and that's 'top ten of all time.' I stumbled across 'Two XXXXX' by accident (maybe that made it all the more special -- no inflated expectations) on IFC one night, and couldn't believe that I hadn't heard anything about it. Now that XXXXX Ledger is getting more famous in the USA, I'm sure it's more available. At the time, I was telling friends about the film, and no one could find it anywhere except the occasional IFC showing.<br /><br />Anyway, in the black-comedy/gangster genre it fits in well with my other favorites, and everybody in the film really seems to end up with what they deserve. XXXXX Brown is hilarious as the main gangster who makes origami with his small son and plays scrabble with his henchmen. Also hilarious is the quick-edit fate of a random car thief. Even XXXXX was pretty good in it. At the time, I vaguely remembered him from a short-lived series on XXX called 'Roar.' XXXXXXXXX Gregor Jordan will make another hit, but as far as I'm concerned, this is his best yet.
