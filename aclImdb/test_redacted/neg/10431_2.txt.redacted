Plodding, maybe that should have been the title. Bad dialogue delivered at a snail's pace. All the characters are single dimension with the exception of one. Unfortunately, that character has some of the worst lines and does not seem to fit into this clich√© ridden two- hour drag. Having grown up in the seventies, this film is seriously lacking in detail, atmosphere and authenticity. Surprisingly, this was produced by XXXXXX Grammar, someone who should recognize sharp dialogue and a consistent narrative in a script. XXXXXXX Richardson is about the only element that lights up this film. XXXXX Trower's music is also a welcomed addition.
