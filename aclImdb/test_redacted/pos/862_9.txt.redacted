Wow, XXXXXX XXXXXX are great! Lots of patrons from The State and XXXXXX, the TV show. I never knew that XXXXXX could have gotten any better then they were on the TV show XXXXXX or even Comedy Central Presents: XXXXXX. I also never knew short comedies could be any good. My favorite ones were XXXXX, Racking Leaves, The Woods and XXXXX arranges to a meeting with his long lost cousin Greg. I think over all that XXXXX was the funniest one. Its funny when he doesn't make sense. I like the music in the shorts. Thats something I pay attention to a lot. They always had good taste in music. I wish they still made shorts, either that or bring back there sitcom. I hope they continue making good and funny comedy.
