This is an incredibly fun action/exploitation 80s rocker. XXXXXXX Bronson rules as Paul Kirsey. The villains are hilariously bad. The soundtrack, by XXXXX Page is laughably bad. XXXX Winter (Bill of Bill & Ted) is great as one of the street punks who gets wasted by Bronson and crew. Crew? Oh, those are the downtrodden townsfolk who team up with XXXXXXX to win back the streets. The whole movie is enjoyable, with the last half hour or so exploding into non-stop action and mayhem. 9/10
