Only the Brits could make a film like this and have it be so tastefully charming! Betty (XXXXXX Blethyn) wants something more out of life, but she doesn't know what, when she realizes she is in love with her childhood friend, XXXXX (XXXXXX XXXXXX), who owns the local funeral parlor. Meanwhile, an American mortician (XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXX) who "wants to put the 'fun' back in funerals" moves into this small Welsh community with his assistant (XXX XXXXX) and wants to give XXXXX a run for his money with flashy, themed funerals. (Star Trek funeral, anyone?) XXXXXX and XXXXX decide to stage XXXXXX's death and funeral, with hilarious results. A very enjoyable film - if you're a fan of British comedies such as "Waking Ned Devine", you'll love this.
