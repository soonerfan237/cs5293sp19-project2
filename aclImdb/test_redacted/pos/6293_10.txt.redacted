One of our all time family favorites. When we need a laugh...we just put this one in and laugh all way thru like it is the first time we've seen it. This film has good, clean family humor. XXXXX Shore is brilliant! With no plans for the thanksgiving holiday, Crawl (Shore) is invited to spend the holiday with a conservative coed, XXXXX. Crawl, being a big city boy, must adjust to the farm life if he is to fall in love with XXXXX. But, XXXXX isn't the only one who is learning new things. Crawl teaches XXXXX and her parents how to be more open about their feelings and accepting others. This is fun for viewers of all ages.
