I saw this short film on the dvd for XXXXXX Scott's film, The Duellists. There was no introduction by XXXXX before the film, it just started right up.<br /><br /> Boy and a Bicycle is hardly an example of Ridley XXXXX's other work, it bears no resemblance. The film shows a boy, played by XXXX Scott, riding around on a bicycle. Guess what? That's pretty all that happens. The boy rides around, rambling on and on with pointless, confusing dialogue. The film was shot in black and white, and since it was directed by XXXXXX Scott, I expected some cool cinematography or visually-striking sets. Instead, I was treated with nothing. This film isn't even good for a first effort. However, I recommend that any fan of XXXXXX Scott should check it out at least once.
