This is the worst film I've seen in a looooong time. It reminded me of a Cirque du XXXXXX show I saw in Vegas six years ago -- without the athleticisme. By that I mean a few striking, artsy, images appear randomly, without any sustaining framework. The fake sepia tinted film is really tacky. This device is almost never justified and certainly is not in _Tuvalu_. With apologies to XXX Lincoln: you can fool some of the people some of the time.
