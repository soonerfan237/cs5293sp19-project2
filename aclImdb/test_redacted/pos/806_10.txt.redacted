This movie deserves a 20/10 if I could give one. "THE HOLLOW" is a great XXXXXXX Poirot novel and the twist at the end fools most people. I am overjoyed that this movie stayed completely faithful to the novel. There was no major difference that I could spot. The only difference was that XXXXXX was introduced into the story earlier that in the novel. The acting was superb, and the music, as usual, was amazing quality! XXXXX Suchet is perfect in his role, and the rest of the cast is perfect in their respective roles either. In no other movie that I've seen so far has XXXXXX been portrayed so brilliantly! Hats off to the producers-- they have made a movie that I along with many others will cherish for a long time to come!
