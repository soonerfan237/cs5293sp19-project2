After a man turns up dead, a soldier becomes the prime suspect. Undoubtedly the best film to feature three XXXXXXX and all of them are in fine form. Young is the cool-headed, pipe-smoking cop investigating the murder, XXXXXXX is the murder suspect's concerned friend, and Ryan is a hot-headed soldier with something to hide. Grahame has a brief but effective role as a femme fatale. XXXXXX Tarzan Barker has a bit part as a soldier. This film touches on anti-semitism, a subject also covered in Best Picture Oscar winner "XXXXXXXXX's Agreement," which was released the same year. It is solidly directed by XXXXXXX, who creates an effective film noir atmosphere.
