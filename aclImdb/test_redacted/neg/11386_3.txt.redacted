Somehow, this documentary about XXXXX manages to include very little music and no complete tunes. Though XXXXX appears in the film, 95% of the interviews are other folks, not XXXXX. There are huge chronological gaps, many aspects of his life (his childhood prodigy, his drug addiction) are skipped or glossed over, and you'll learn little about what made the man and his contribution to music so groundbreaking. Skip it.
