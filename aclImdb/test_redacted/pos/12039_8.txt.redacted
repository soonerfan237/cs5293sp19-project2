This isn't far away from the trash that XXXXXXXXX normally makes but there's just something really good about it.<br /><br />The title song is one of XXXXXXXXXs best and is haunting throughout. This is one of the films (along with Baazigar - a must see XXXXXXXXX film) that made Shah Rukh Khan and it's for this you have to check it out.<br /><br />Other reviews give away the story - it is a fairly basic idea - ShaRukh definitely stands out and one of his final expressions right at the end made me give this film an extra star.<br /><br />Its fairly cheesy but definitely worth watching if you are new to XXXXXXXXX or not! 8/10
