Top gun without the in-house animosity. Or class. Or money. Or Cruise. An excuse for an upwardly mobile cast of next-big-thing actors to market their ability to lead a matin√©e this doesn't really have anything anyone can get their teeth into. It's a shame because the opening shot of XXXXXXX Sheen opens out with great promise which is squandered almost straight away with a preposterous wedding set piece. Barking.<br /><br />XXXXXX Haysbert is a changeable actor for me but in this film he is fine, particularly the action sequences. XXXXXXX Biehn is a first-class action hero but not a leading man: Charlie Sheen is, to all intents and purposes, the leading man but never quite an action hero. There's a stunt cast of hundreds who are also mentionworthy. 3/10
