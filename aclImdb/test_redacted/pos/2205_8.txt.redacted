I have only praise for this film. From start to finish it captured the brilliance of XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX's musical. I am not a big fan of musicals most of them are very overdone. This one however changed my mind. I am an actor myself and have actully played XXXXXXX and I know how hard this role is. XXXXXX XXXXX gave a stunning, masterful and rounded performance worthy of the highest awards that we can give him (He won an Emmy and that's something.) Everything he does he turns to gold. He is so good it will blow your mind why he's not in films winning oscars. Lansbury is also very good and very funny. XXXX XXXXX is creepy and wonderful as the Beggar Woman. All in all a great video. Pick it up if you can.
