conventional and superficial ,Claude´s portrayal was incomplete it is supposed that just a few moments with XXXXXX , makes him win her love , but the story itself and the songs make it and enjoyable experience essentially the final sequence .Altough i don´t know why it was given a PG rating .<br /><br />
