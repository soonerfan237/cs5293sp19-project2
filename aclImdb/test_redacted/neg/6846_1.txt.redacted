The most hardcore bad film buff will be surprised by the overall ineptness of this grade-z "film". XXXX Woronov, a clever actress best known for her roles as XXXX Bland in Eating Raoul and Miss Togar in Rock 'N' Roll High School, is by far the best thing about this tripe. This film is almost too bad even for MST3K - honestly!
