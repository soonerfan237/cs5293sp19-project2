Good footage of World War I-era ships and planes supplement this excellent war drama set in the Adriatic. XXXXXX Huston is excellent as the commanding officer who knows his place and his place has no room for personal feelings. The safety of the ship and the mission must always come first. XXXXXX Montgomery is the Lieutenant who has not yet mastered the role that a leader must play in combat. He makes bad decisions, endangering the submarine and its crew but finally becomes a "real man" after he is court martialed and dismissed from the Navy. XXXXXX Young plays a lieutenant junior grade and Jimmy Durante as a cook. Paralleling the war drama is an equally important wartime love triangle between Montgomery and XXXXX Evans who plays Huston's daughter and the wife of a tragically injured aviator. Recommended.
