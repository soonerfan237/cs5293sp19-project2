I enjoyed XXXXX & Stefan Â– a cool and fast story which didn't get bogged down in detail. Those two guys are great to see and are able to come up with new ideas all the time. The high quality of picture and cut support the movie a lot.<br /><br />Erkan & XXXXXX show that the German film industry is capable of transferring successful Hollywood concepts with local `satire' into our cinemas.
