Personally, I don't like a lot of b/w movies, but there's something magical about this movie. <br /><br />The movie starts with XXXXXXXXX XXXX (XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX). "XXX" writes a magazine column about how she's the 'Martha XXXXXXX' of Connecticut. Of course, she's lying. This becomes a problem when her publisher, Mr Yardley, asks her to play host to a NAVY sailor over XXXXXXXXX. In addition, Mr Yardley, who's going to be alone for XXXXXXXXX, invites himself up to the farm for the XXXXXXXXX party. From there, things just go crazy.<br /><br />Since the movie is set on a New England farm, the movie has a warm holiday feeling. Plus, the characters are hilarious. XXX Yardley is always shouting orders, and XXX's friend XXXXX is always yelling 'Catastroph!' when things go wrong. Finally, the movie ends the way a XXXXXXXXX movie should end; a jolly fat man laughs and shouts "What a XXXXXXXXX!" <br /><br />In short, no matter what age you are, you will love this movie.
