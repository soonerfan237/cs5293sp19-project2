XXXX is a great movie! XXXXXXXX plays an obsessed lover who will do almost anything to win over his lady which in this case is XXXX XXXXXX. Little does XXXX know in the film that XXXXXXXX has a MAJOR crush on her and is constantly stalking her. I have to admit, some of the things he did in this movie were pretty creepy... like the threatening phone calls. Never in my life will I forget the line, "I love you K..k..k..Kiran!"<br /><br />It's just too bad that XXXXXXXX and XXXX weren't exactly "together" in the film. But XXXX and Sunny do make a fairly good couple in the movie. Though XXXXXXXX's role was pretty psychotic, I still think he did a great job of playing it and can't possibly imagine anyone else doing that role. No wonder he got an award for XXXX in 94'!<br /><br />XXXX... what can I say??? She looks especially amazing in this film! It's not that she doesn't always look amazing in her other films, but XXXX did give the public a wonderful image of her!<br /><br />As for the music... it was excellent! Especially "XXXXX XXXX XXXXX," one of my all time favorite songs. I also thought "Tu Mere Samne" was quite nice also.<br /><br />A must see for everyone! Overall XXXX deserves a 9/10!
