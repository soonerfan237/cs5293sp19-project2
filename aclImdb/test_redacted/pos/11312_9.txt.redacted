This movie was a riot, it pokes fun of "XXXXXXX - Truth Or Dare" in all the right places. I love XXXXXXX & I love Julie Brown. How could I ask for more..Julie's spoof of "Vogue", entitled "Vague" was hysterical.. "XXXXX LeBrock thinks she's great, she's just cold boogers on a paper plate". "XXXXXX Shields, Dawber, Pam personality of Spam"!! I could've died! And just wait till you see what she can do with a watermelon!!
