HUNT FOR JUSTICE is a Canadian television drama that has made it to DVD and that is reason for gratitude for those who hunger for educational dramas that inform us about facts of current history that somehow get buried in the media. The film is not a Hollywood production, it relies heavily on footage from court files, but it also introduces to many of us the act of heroism of XXXXXX XXXXXX in bringing about the trial of Yugoslavian President XXXXXXXX Milosevic.<br /><br />XXXXXX XXXXXX (veteran Canadian actor XXXXX XXXXXXX) is a Canadian judge appointed by NATO as the Chief War Crimes Prosecutor at the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague. The film begins in 1996 when XXXXXX travels to The Hague to face the political obstacles that are preventing the Tribunal to bringing to justice the war criminals in the war Yugoslavia has been waging in Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia, a war that has gross evidence of crimes against humanity in the form of genocide, extermination camps, and other heinous abuses. The progress toward bringing the criminals to justice is hampered by generals (including one played by XXXXXXX XXXX) who fear a major World War if precautions against same are infringed upon. XXXXXX, with the keen help of her translator XXXXX XXXXX (Stipe Erceg), her staff including Keller (XXXXX XXXXX) and the unexpected assistance from British Capt. XXXX XXXXXX (XXXX XXXXXXX), forges ahead, focusing the impossible task of bringing all responsible parties to justice on three specific events. Two of the three top suspects are captured but during their trials each meets his end. This leaves only XXXXXXXX Milosevic himself, and XXXXXX and her colleagues are successful in bringing the war criminal to justice in 1999.<br /><br />There are several touching side plots employed in the telling of this well-documented tale, stories that make the point in history more personal. Some may find the film footage of corpses and prisoners and death camps too strong to watch, but they are necessary to bring home the purpose of the film. XXXXX XXXXXXX carries the power to drive the message home - the message that war crimes must never go unpunished. There is much current history to be learned from this film: writers XXX XXXXX, XXXXX XXXXX and M.A. Lovretta have condensed the information and made it dramatic as well. XXXXXXXX XXXXXXX XXXXXX balances the docudrama with the story progress, never forgetting that he has a tale of intrigue to tell as well. HUNT FOR JUSTICE is worth watching! XXXXX Harp
