XXX Margera of the Jackass fame is back with his own reality show, and not only is it not as funny as Jackass, but it's also amazingly stupider! This has to be one of the dumbest shows ever conceived. Sure there are worse reality shows but none are as mean spirited or as dumb.<br /><br />Bam XXXXXXX has made it big, and his parents decided to piggy bank off of his fame. XXX and his parents, his uncle, his crew of idiotic friends all live together, and while XXX and his buddies are off breaking things and getting into mischief, generally his parents are at home being stupid. When XXX's parents aren't at home being lazy, they're being tortured by XXX, especially his father. To add to the humor, we are treated to his fat uncle XXX Vitto who is constantly out of it, and never paying attention.<br /><br />This show really is like a toned down version of Jackass...toned down in that there aren't stunts, instead Bam and his buddies just go break stuff, and do lame stunts, and meanwhile loud music plays to make it all the more awesome. This is not funny in the least. I can't imagine a dumber show than this because there is not an ounce of intelligence found here.<br /><br />If you are a big fan of XXX Margera, and want to see one of the many follow up/cash-in sequels to the Jackass series.<br /><br />My rating: * out of ****. 30 mins.
