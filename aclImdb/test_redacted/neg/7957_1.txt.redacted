Copy cats have copied this movie from a 1974 Hindi movie called "XXXX Girl"! "Call XXXX" had an identical story line. The way in which the protagonists fall in love, then rebel and the climax all same in both these films! "Call XXXX" is better than Water, at least from the story telling point of view. It was not as agonizingly slow as XXXXX! XXXXX on the contrary does not progresses at all. The aim is perhaps to make the audience sympathize with XXXXXXX for ever! Are Indian film makers any better than just being great copiers these days? Well they call it "being inspired". In their language it is: "getting inspired (without any citation that is!)"! :)
