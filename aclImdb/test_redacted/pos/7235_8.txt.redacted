This trash version of `Romeo and XXXXXX' passes in Manhattan in the present days. Romeo (XXXX Keenan) is an a**hole and violent member of family Que, and Juliet (Jane Jensen) is a sexy (with beautiful legs and breasts) and bisexual girl of Capulet family. The scatological situations this romantic pair will face are very funny. Although being a cult movie (inclusive exhibited in Rio de XXXXXXX Festival), it is not recommended for all the audiences. If the viewer is fan of XXXXX Jackson's former movies (`Braindead', `Bad Taste'), `Toxic Avenger', `Body Melt' and other trash movie, he will certainly love this flick. Otherwise, he will hate it. Since I belong to the first group, my vote is eight.<br /><br />
