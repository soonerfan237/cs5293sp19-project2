I never realized what a fabulous dancer XXXX XXXXXX was until I saw this movie. She was only 19 years old and gorgeous. What a pleasure to watch her dance with XXXXXX XXXXXX. The story line was typical for its day but the dancing was really special. I never tire of watching XXXX and XXXXXX but XXXX XXXXXX in this movie was just as terrific. I always thought of Lana as a so-so actress who tended to over act. She should have done more dancing and less of the XXXXXX X and XXXXXX XXXXX roles. I had a new appreciation for her after seeing this movie and her wonderful dancing. Too bad the "Academy" doesn't give an "Oscar" for dancing.
