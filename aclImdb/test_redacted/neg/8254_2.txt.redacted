Oops. I hired this because I thought it was XXXXXX harvest (1981), which was recommended. After the appearance of the appalling XXXXX Kensit, I checked the recommendation and discovered my mistake. OK, It's watchable, because the main characters are very sexy, but the acting is awful. XXXXXXX Baldwin looks morose the whole time, which is understandable, considering his co-star. Is XXXXX competing with Liz Hurley for the title of the most obviously useless actor on the screen?
