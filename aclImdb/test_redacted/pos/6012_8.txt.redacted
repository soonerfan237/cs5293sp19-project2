After clocking up five seasons on the small screen from 1976-79, 'XXXXXX & XXXXXXX' transferred themselves to the big screen in mid 1980. Instead of XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX and XXXXX XXXXX retaining their roles as writers, XXXX XXXXXXXX was brought on board as the writer. Sadly, this film adaption just did not seem to hit the spot with the public. Shame. I liked it, better than the series itself in fact. It was a guilty pleasure.<br /><br />'XXXXXXX XXXXX' (XXXXXX XXXXX) is keen to ascertain whether or not her slovenly husband 'XXXXXX' (XXXXX XXXXXX) has remembered their wedding anniversary. Obviously, he hasn't, but to try and convince his wife otherwise he books a table at the restaurant where he proposed marriage to XXXXXXX several years ago.<br /><br />Upon arriving at the restaurant, they find out that the place has changed hands. Eventually seeing through XXXXXX's lies, XXXXXXX insists that they celebrate their anniversary at a swanky hotel. Upon arriving at the hotel, XXXXXX is mistaken by crook 'Harry XXXXX' (XXXXXXXXX XXXXX) for a ruthless hit-man, who wants a rival to be exterminated!<br /><br />Not an outstanding comedy as such but a good natured piece of fun all the same. Plans to revive the series after the film's showing were sadly terminated when XXXXXX XXXXX died on 24th August 1980 of alcohol poisoning.<br /><br />Funniest moment- XXXXXX talking to his favourite garden gnome. His neighbour, XXXXXXXX creeps up behind him and says ''I think its time we had a chat''. XXXXXX, thinking it has developed the power of speech, drops the gnome in shock!<br /><br />XXXXX XXXXXXXXX to fellow IMDb users, in particular 'AdamFontaine', 'Cyril XXXXX' and 'TheLittleSongBird'. Have a good one!
