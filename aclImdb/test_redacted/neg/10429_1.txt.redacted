Any film school student could made a film 1,000 times better than piece of garbage. As someone who had read the book, I expected even a straight re-telling of the book would make this a fair film. There was a chance that a talented director could go beyond XXXXXXXX's narrative and make a great film.<br /><br />Well the director did go beyond XXXXXXXX's narrative. He added a hip Hispanic angel named XXXXXXXXX that was not in the book. He had XXX Woodward interview the dead Belushi in an exchange in the morgue. The film had all the insight of someone stoned on PCP staring at his navel.<br /><br />If this is a spoiler to you, you will thank me for it because it is absolutely the worst movie ever made.
