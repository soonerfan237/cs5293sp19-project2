All I have to say is one word...SUCKS!!!!. The only reason I gave this a 2 is because XXXX Hartnett was in it and he's cool. Should have beat that XXXXX guys ass...stupid dumb and brainless. By the end of this movie you can't stand XXXXX and you really don't care what happens to Leelee. XXXXXXXX was the only good thing about it.
