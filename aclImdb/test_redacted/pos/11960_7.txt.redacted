It's a simple fact that there are many of us from the 80's generation who grew up loving those loopy XXXX XXXXXX comedies made by XXXXXX XXXXX XXXXXXX, and while I prefer there other more bizarre, out-there flick, XXXXXX XXX XXXX, it's hard for me to dislike One Crazy Summer, a movie I grew up loving wholeheartedly as a kid into my teens. OCS was a follow-up to XXXXXX XXX XXXX, returning XXXXXX and XXXXXX XXXXXXXXX from that film. <br /><br />XXXXXX is XXXXX, following graduation pal XXXX XXXXXX(XXXXXX)to Nantucket for the summer to each some fun on the beach. XXXXX finds himself embroiled in a feud with a blonde, buff punk named XXXXX XXXXXXXXXX whose lecherous father has designs on bulldozing over homes of a neighborhood to build a giant condominium. One of the homes, needing it's mortgage repaid belongs to XXXX XXXXX(XXXXXXXXX). There's a sailboat race which might be their only hope of saving XXXXXXXXX's grandfather's home(..he had recently passed), but it has been won by XXXXX over the past many years, and XXXXX is deathly afraid of boats over water. But, with the help and motivation of newfound Nantucket friends(..such as XXXXXX XXXXXXXX and XXX XXXXXXX as auto-mechanic twin brothers!), XXXXXX, and budding love-interest XXXXXXXXX, perhaps XXXXX can come to terms with his fears and win the race to save the neighborhood. Armstrong has a supporting part as the son of a kooky, manic weapons salesman, General Raymond(..SCTV's XXX XXXXXXXX in an inspired bit of casting), XXX, who uses the training from his father to assist XXXXX and company in their goals to win the race. <br /><br />Memorable scenes include XXXXXX getting stuck in a Godzilla suit(!)running rampant across an entire model of XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX(XXXX XXXXXXX, barely recognizable as XXXXX's rather unhinged pops)'s condominium, XXXXX being chased by deranged cub scouts wishing to perform first aid, XXXXXX a victim of toxic flatulence, XXXXX XXXXXX's nutty XXXXX XXXXX's increasing insanity every time he tries to better his chances to win 1 million dollars from a radio show, and the wonderful XXXXXX XXXX as XXXXXX's grandma who actually bills the group after a meal! XXXXXX Piven as(you guessed it)a brutish jerk who associates with XXXXX and causes trouble for XXXXX and his posse, the yummy XXXXXXXX XXXXXX as Cookie(..XXXXX's girl who attempts to make-out with XXXXX while he attends a luncheon with his father), and the one-and-only XXXXXXX XXXXXX as Old Man Beckersted, who will not reward his son and grandson an inheritance if they lose the sail boat race. XXXX XXXXX is cute, but this is XXXXXX's vehicle, though XXXXXX and XXXXXXX steal most of the scenes their in. Again, some delightful animation from Holland are sprinkled throughout the movie(XXXXX is an artist, appropriately). If you like his movies, I highly recommend the underrated, How I Got Into College.
