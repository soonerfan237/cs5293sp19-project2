XXXXXX put, XXXX XXXXXXX and XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX were remarkable. The movie is less about the raw science of XXXXXX's beliefs, and holds the focus very strongly on his relationship with his family, primarily his wife, XXXX, and daughter, XXXXXX<br /><br />Toby XXXXX gives a wonderful turn as XXXXXX XXXXXX, the great defender of XXXXXX's beliefs, and the rest of the cast is up to the task of sharing screen time with XXXXXXX and XXXXXXXX.<br /><br />But it is those two who carry the movie. Their real chemistry is apparent from beginning to end, but develops transcendence as XXXXXX grapples with his demons. The scene where XXXXXX relates the ending of the story of Jenny, the orangutan, to his dying daughter, XXXXX, is utterly gripping. The world premiere audience at the TIFF was spellbound. XXXXXXX's performance will be recognized as one of the year's best in short order. Equally magnificent is XXXXXXXX's work playing the religious wife of a man who, in Huxley's words, "killed God".<br /><br />The film moves slowly through the entire spectrum of XXXXXX's grief, relishing every detail of XXXXXXX and XXXXXXXX's acting.<br /><br />Brilliant.
