Continuing his comeback, XXXX Travolta played a mildly twisted angel in "Michael". He may be a messenger of God, but he's not the nicest guy, as reporters XXXXX MacDowell and William Hurt discover. When I first saw this movie, it was before I had started watching "All in the Family", so I didn't recognize XXXX Stapleton as Edith Bunker. Now that I recognize her like that, I try to imagine XXXXXX snapping at her for harboring an angel (whom he would probably rank alongside blacks, Jews, etc).<br /><br />I know, that doesn't really relate to the movie. But I just like to associate things that way. Anyway, it's a pretty interesting movie. Also starring XXX Hoskins, Teri Garr and Richard Schiff.<br /><br />What John and Paul said...
