Well it is a good movie. However, you have to admit that XXX XXXX's movies haven't been so great lately. On the other hand if you are a hardcore van Dame fan you should watch this as there is a huge improvement with fighting scenes. Also What i really liked is the music beautiful music. am sure this will kill time if you are action fan. As for XXXXX XXXXXXXXXX the director of Undisputed 2, i don't think he did a good job as he did with Undisputed.I cant wait when one day XXX XXXX's movies hit the cinemas before the DVD. Maybe, one day:).<br /><br />In the end it worth the watch if you got no other action movies to watch, this could make your hour and half fun.
