One of my favorites non-MGM musicals, it's a classic!> XXXX XXXXXXXX is in top form, her beauty leaps out of the screen. XXXX XXXXX shows off his dancing skills and introduces to musicals his edgy and innovative choreography that eventually would change the way musicals are choreograph. XXXX Silvers is the perfect second bananas, and XXX XXXXX injects this movie with a lot of class.<br /><br /> The structure is so theatrical that one has to wonder why, in this era where major Broadway shows come from the movies, XXXXX XXXX hasn't been adapted to theatre.
