I taped The Morrison Murders on XXXXXXXX Movie network and I watched The Morrison Murders on XXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXX Movie network and on Courttv. XXXXXXXX Scarfe and John Corbett did a great job of playing Luke and Walker Morrison. I am glad that XXXXXX got his brother Luke to confess of murdering his parents and their brother Bobby. I enjoy watching True stories on XXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXX Movie network and on Courttv. The Morrison Murders is a good movie to watch. Next time The Morrison Murders is on XXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXX Movienetwork or Courttv I am going to watch The Morrrison Murders again because My favorite actor John Corbbett is in The Morrison Murders. I give The Morrison Murders a ten because it is a good movie about XXXXXX who tries to find out who killed his parents and his brother Bobby and at the end XXXXXX discovers it was his brother Luke who murdered his parents and his brother Bobby.
