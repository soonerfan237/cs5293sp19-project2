The title role of this western is played by XXXXXX Walker, Jr. He's a young gun who with partner XXXXX Carradine gets separated after doing a contract hit on a Mexican general. In eluding their pursuers XXXXXXXXX and Walker become separated. Walker comes upon the camp of lawman XXXXXX Mitchum who takes a liking to Walker and makes him a protégé and reclamation project of sorts.<br /><br />This is the first of two films XXXXXX Mitchum did with writer/director Burt Kennedy. The second was the more humorous The Good Guys and the Bad Guys. <br /><br />Not that XXXXX Billy XXXXX does not have its moments of hilarity. But it is a tripartite story involving the Walker reclamation, XXXXXXX's hunt for the bad who killed his son and a romantic triangle involving XXXXXXX, Angie Dickinson, and town boss Jack Kelly.<br /><br />The film abounds with nepotism. XXXXX Carradine is John's son. XXXX Martin's daughter XXXXa is in this, Walker is the son of Robert Walker and Jennifer Jones and Mitchum's son Chris plays Mitchum's son in some silent flashbacks.<br /><br />Robert Mitchum got his start in westerns and always looks right at home in them. XXXXX Dickinson essentially repeats the role she had in Rio Bravo. XXXXXX had a brief career playing rebellious youths and doing a good job at it. I've often wondered what happened to him. He looks hauntingly like his father. Maybe he didn't want to come to such a tragic early end like his father.<br /><br />And it that wasn't enough, Mitchum fans get to hear old rumple eyes sing the title song at the beginning of the film.
