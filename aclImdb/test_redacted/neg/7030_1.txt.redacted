I didn't think this movie was very good at all. Basically they took a bunch of one-liners from various XXXXXXX Temple movies, threw them together, and had Orr act like XXXXXXX Temple acted on-screen. "Oh my goodness!" was said quite a number of times. If you are familiar with XXXXXXX Temple movies, you will recognize several lines direct from her movies. The trouble is they have Orr saying these in Shirley's everyday life. In the end, what we get is a hodgepodge of re-created XXXXXXX Temple movies, instead of any sort of real look into XXXXXXX Temple's life. Save yourself the trouble and rent XXXXXXX Temple movies, it's a lot better than watching Orr try and recreate XXXXXXX's acting style.
