Gloria Swanson (as XXXXX Porter) is an understandably bored wife. Workaholic husband XXXXXXX Dexter (as James Denby Porter) has "lost his romance" along with his waistline; he also smokes cigars in bed, eats onions, and snores. He can barely remember his own anniversary - which is attended by caddish XXX Cody (as Schuyler Van Sutphen); the younger man eyes Ms. Swanson's voluptuous figure, and flirts unabashedly. Soon, XXXXXXX is drawn to Mr. Cody. Then, XXX Dexter decides to try and get her back. Who will win? <br /><br />The three principals are fine, with XXXXXXX most impressive in the pivotal role as the woman torn. XXXXX Faye grabs supporting honors as Cody's other interest, "Toodles"; off-screen, she tempted director Cecil B. DeMille. The DeMille touch is evident; especially in an imaginary sequence wherein Cody promises XXXXXXX... "Pleasure Wealth Love" <br /><br />******* Don't Change Your Husband (1/26/19) Cecil B. DeMille ~ Gloria XXXXXXX, Elliott Dexter, Lew Cody
