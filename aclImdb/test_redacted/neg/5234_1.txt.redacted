** May contain spoilers ** XXXXXXXX. Just horrible. I loved XXXXXXX King's novel, and this is just a horrible adaptation of it. They change the ending. They change the plot. They changed XXXX Pangborne's character from a grieving husband to a happy fianc√©. If you are a fan of XXXXXXX King's novel, stay away. Even if You are not, stay away.<br /><br />The book was awesomely dark, even for XXXXX King. An 11 year old kills himself in the novel. A middle school principal is found with child pornography in the novel. THis is nowhere near as good as the novel.<br /><br />This movie is my least favorite film of all time. I hate this film with a vengeance.
