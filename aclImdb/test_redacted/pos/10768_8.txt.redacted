In the 2nd of his Historical Martial Arts films, Chiba portrays his real life sensei XXX Oyama. The film even recreates XXXXX's incredible feat of killing a raging bull with his bare hands (XXXXX did this feat over 50 times in real life). XXXXXXX fight choreography featuring authentic Kyokushinkai techniques. Ironically this is one of the rare XXXXX Chiba films in which he DOESN'T tear out or rip off body parts of opponents. A must see for XXXXX Chiba fans definitely one of his top 5 films
