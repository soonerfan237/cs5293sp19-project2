This is my favorite Renoir from the Fifties. It's the story of how XXXXX XXXXXXXX built and launched the Moulin Rouge nightclub; we see the workmen blasting at the site to get construction underway, and the training of the dancers. Finally, the giddiness of opening night and the long sequence of cancan dancing. Financial problems and the ego displays of the performers are described.<br /><br />XXXXX is in great form as the easy-going XXXXXXXX--see him deal humorously with XXXX's violent boyfriend. XXXXXX Esposito is moving as the wistful Prince who is courting XXXX. XXXXX Felix, with that amazon's body, is imposing as the egotistical XXXX, XXXXXXXX's first lover. Finally XXXXXXXXX XXXXXX as XXXX the washing girl who ends up dancing for XXXXXXXX, and becoming his girl, is just stunning; her loveliness and pert charm will win you over.<br /><br />A bonus: we get XXXXX XXXX, XXXXXXXX, XXXXX XXXXXXX and other stars in cameos playing the stars of a century ago who ruled over the Moulin rouge.
