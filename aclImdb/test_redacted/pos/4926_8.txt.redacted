I love this movie... it can make me laugh! =^_^= XXXXX is kinda hard to do. This movie is one of the best cartoon adaptations ever. It doesn't warp the characters like other movies out there. Everyone is in character and has a role to play!<br /><br />The movie focuses around XXXXXX and Babs going down river after a flood (courtesy of XXXXXX), to Plucky going on a trip with Hamton (hilarious stuff), Elmyra running around torturing animals (as usual), Fifi following her crush around for an autograph, and Shirley and Fowlmouth going to the movies.<br /><br />In my own personal opinion, I didn't like the XXXXXX and Babs segments that much, although they had some notable dialogue and jokes. I have got to say the Plucky and XXXXXXX 'Vacation' parts were the best! Hamton's family is HILARIOUS! I especially like XXXXX Stinky. Fifi in the hotel was also hilarious. I love the actor cameos during this scene. :D<br /><br />Probably the most famous part in this movie, again IMHO, is when XXXXXXXXX and Shirley are in the movie theater... LOL! You've got to see it to appreciate it! And when XXXXXX and Plucky go through the tunnel to make a wish... :)<br /><br />Although this movie moved slowly during the Buster/Babs parts, the rest is pure gold! I rate this movie 8/10. Show this to your kids one day... or even adults yourselves - WATCH THIS MOVIE! You won't regret it.
