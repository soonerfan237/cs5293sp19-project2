An interesting movie with XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX as a young woman who travels to Europe in an attempt to find out what became of her older sister (XXXXXXX XXXX) who mysteriously died years earlier. Brewster is very good and keeps you involved despite some unrealistic plotting, such as having her amazinly find and start a romance with her dead sister's much older boyfriend (XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX). Still, mostly good. GRADE: B
