This is a fine, under-rated film and XXX Torn, well-known as he is, is a seriously under-rated actor. I read XXXXXX Frank Mosher's novel many years ago. How well XXXXXX captures the book and the beauty of Vermont's Northeast Kingdom! I had the good fortune to grow up in VT in the 40s and 50s and was still living there when the "Irasburg Incident" took place. I've not seen XXXXXXXXX in the Kingdom_, the Craven/Mosher collaboration based on the incident(and another Mosher novel), but this film has inspired me to track it down.
