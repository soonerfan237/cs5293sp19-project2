In & XXX was a funny comedy with good performances by Joan Cusack, Tom Selleck, Matt Dillon, and Kevin Kline. The thought of XXXXX Kline being gay was very funny. If I was him, I would hate to say I'm gay at his own wedding with his family, friends, and his going to be wife there. Very seldom would that ever happen. I also loved when he was dancing around when the voice on the radio was talking to him. I'd say that In & XXX was a silly comedy with a lot of laughs and giggles. This is a recommended comedy and XXXXX Kline had a great performance as a gay guy. Trust me you'll like this movie.<br /><br />7/10
