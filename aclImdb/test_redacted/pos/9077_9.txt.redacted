*Flat SPOILERS* <br /><br />Five med students, XXXXXX (XXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX), XXXXX XXXXXXXXX (XXXXX XXXXX), XXXXXX XXXXXX (XXXXX XXXXXXX), XXX XXXXXX (XXXXXXX XXXXXXX) & XXXXX XXXXXXX (XXXXXX XXXXX) decide to attempt an experiment; dying for exactly 5 minutes (it is the maximum amount of time somebody can do this before being risk of brain damage).<br /><br />Almost everyone does this experiment, XXXXX being the lone exception, but they begin to have unwelcome visitors; XXXXX sees a little black girl shouting crude insults to him, XXX sees all the women he has had sex with (and which he videotaped) asking him why from the TV XXXXXX, XXXXXX relives her father's suicide and XXXXXX faces a little boy with murderous intentions.<br /><br />Why are they here? And how will they get rid of them? This tense and interesting movie, set in an hallucinated city and into a Gothic Med School, is quite the experience, both for the story and the characters, played by then-budding stars such as XXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX, XXXXX XXXXXXX, XXXXXX XXXXX, XXXXX XXXXX and XXXXXXX XXXXXXX.<br /><br />The director is XXXl Schumacher, who had already worked with Sutherland in 'Lost Boys', and this second cooperation is even better than the first.<br /><br />A must for psychological-thriller-horror buds and metaphor lovers (this story is about forgiveness and righting of past wrongs), this is one of the minor classics from the '80s that get respect even today, like the mention by XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX in 'Scream 2' or the Tru Calling episode which used the movie's premise.<br /><br />Flatliners: 9/10.
