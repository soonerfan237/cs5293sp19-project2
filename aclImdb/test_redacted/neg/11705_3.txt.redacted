I must not have seen the same movie as the one the comments refer to here. First, I think they should have serialized XXXXX Story if they were going to film it at all. The truncated version they come up with was awful. I felt the performances were mannered and so much was left out of the story that the performances of such masters as XXXXXXX, Douglas, Houseman, and Fairbanks seemed hammy. Alice XXXXX was superb as Eva, though. XXXXX Wasson is a good actor but he was only adequate as the protagonist. The decision to cast XXXXXXXX Neal and to truncate her role was not a good one. Imagine what XXXX Bancroft would have done with that character! I blame the script, which was poor. The production values were dark and the pacing was slow. A disappointing, pedestrian effort.<br /><br />The book is one of the five greatest suspense/horror novels of the 20th century, IMHO. But the movie was disappointing, although a great introduction for XXXXX.
