This is a 100% improvement over the dross of a third movie and it's one hell of a good time. This is a XXXX XXXXXX movie meets The Devil's Rejects. I really enjoyed this movie and it really stands out as the savior of the series. I thought XXXXXXXX XXXXX played XXXXXXX really well and XXXX XXXXXX in XXXXXX's shoes once again really makes this movie shine. Actually they're the only good parts of the movie. I got rather bored with XXXXXXXXX XXXXX and XXXX XXXXXX's scenes. It's as if they were thrown in there as a sidetrack and someone to save the day. But XXXXXX and XXXXXXX were great to watch and I really liked the black humor to it. I thought it made the movie stand out more. If you want one hell of a good time then be sure to check this out.<br /><br />7/10.
