There is only one reason this movie is watchable. XXXX Schweiger. He is such a good actor the movie isn't completely terrible. XXX Boll please take up another career. The special effects and action are acceptable. All other aspects were very disappointing. All I can say is that XXXXX Smith (An evening with...) talked about Tim Burton not ever reading the Batman comics and it showed. XXX Boll must not have ever played the video games that he keeps making movies about. If you two ever want to know how it is done go see XXXXXXX Bartkowiak. XXXX was one of the best video games to film adaptations ever. Some people may disagree, but if you watch the movie you can see that the guys at ID had a lot to do with XXXX. It doesn't seem like anyone at UBIsoft was even near this production.
