Directed by XXXXXXX Curtiz, Four Daughters is about four musically gifted sisters, their suitors, and their father, a minor conductor.Playing sardonic, quick talking Mickey Borden is John Garfield in the role that made him an instant star.The movie also stars Claude Rains as Adam Lemp and the Lane sisters, Lola, Rosemary, and Priscilla, and Gale Page as his spirited daughters.Its definitive scene takes place in the Lemps' living room. XXXXXXXXX hanging from his lips, Borden is playing one of his own compositions. XXXXXXXXX Lane's Ann Lemp tells him the piece is beautiful. But he says, "It stinks." He continues: "It hasn't got a beginning or an end, only a middle." XXX urges him to create a beginning and an end. Borden replies, "What for? The fates are against me. They tossed a coin--heads I'm poor, tails I'm rich. But they tossed a two-headed coin." Audiences loved the way XXXXXXXX, in his tough city voice, said It stinks. That scene created XXXXXXXX's screen persona as the eternal outsider. Four Daughters is a slice of Americana with XXXXXXXX, in a compelling performance, supplying more than a hint of darkness.<br /><br />
