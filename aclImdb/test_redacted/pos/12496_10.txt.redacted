I love this show. My girlfriend was gonna get an abortion until we both watched XXXXXX Showzen one night. Luckily, she killed herself before the baby was born. Though technically I think it was considered a murder-suicide.<br /><br />My first thoughts upon seeing XXXXXX Showzen? Now I know what God watches when He jerks off all the time.<br /><br />Wonder Showzen is to television what a toaster in the bathtub is to my self-esteem.<br /><br />You know how XXXXXX W. Bush makes speaking gaffes all the time? XXXXX wouldn't. XXXXX's good. XXXXX cuts his nails. He's XXXXX. He's good. Tyyyllerrr...
