This is the classic western. The good, XXXXX Ford, the dashing hero, the ex-soldier, the man who would not hold a gun again. He eventually has to stand up the the evil land baron, XXXXXX G. Robinson, who owns most of the valley and wants it all. Then,there's XXXXXXX Stanwyck, the real ruler of the roost. XXXXXX G. Robinson's wife, who will allow no one to get in her way, even making XXXXXX G. Robinson look weak. She is so evil that everyone else pales next to her blind ambition and ruthlessness to rule the valley and everyone in it. The gleam in her eye as she sees people face death for her is unnerving. It is worth waiting for.Throw in a young XXXXX Keith and a few others and you have a drama that stands on its own. With the requisite stampedes, shoot-outs, ambushes and close-ups of hard riding cowboys and you have a heck of a western.Without giving anything away, there are enough twists and turns within to make this not just a standard cowboy shoot-em-up.
