This is a silly spoof of private eye thrillers as a novelist(XXXXXXX Cain)is called upon to 'ghostwrite' an autobiography of a colorful, waning Hollywood star(Mickey Rooney). At times silliness becomes obnoxious. This is not Cain at his best. Rooney is way over the top. Notable support from XXXXXXXX Scott, Lionel Stander and the comely Nadia Cassini. Not easy to watch.
