I just watched this, an early XXXXXX Lloyd short film that featured his "glasses" character on Kino Video's DVD of "The XXXXXX Lloyd Collection". He's actually a con man with XXXX Pollard as his partner who gets discovered by Bebe Daniels who herself performs fake s√©ances. What she discovers is that XXXXX and Pollard bilk many customers by dropping fake rings that are "lost". I'll stop there and just say this was quite funny especially when XXXXXX and Snub enter the place Bebe works and encounter some creepy contraptions and put on costumes like Snub trying one of Bebe's outfits. Not too much slapstick but what there is of was also quite funny. So on that note, I recommend Are Crooks Dishonest?
