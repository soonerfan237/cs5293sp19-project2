I own this video as well as the concert version of the musical with XXXXX XXXXXX and XXXXXX XXXXX with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. XXXXXX XXXXX is fantastic in my book as are XXXXXX XXXXXXXX and the composer, XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX. This musical is operatic in scope and shows much ingenuity in composition. I certainly hope that this VHS becomes available on DVD!! Hearn's performance is spookily sympathetic. The one annoying performance is the young woman who sings the role of Joanna. I believe this performance was at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles, rather than on a Broadway stage and am not sure that the minimalist set was utilized in New York, as it was in this production. But I found the scaffolding being dragged across the stage to be quite effective to "portray" the streets of London. I highly recommend this movie.
