A lot of actors have a multitude of good movie roles in their soul. Some, a handful. Others, maybe a couple.<br /><br />Then there's XXXXX Blair. "The Exorcist". That's it.<br /><br />When you see "Chained XXXX" and watch Linda Blair in it, you have to wonder what, if anything, was running through her mind.<br /><br />Certainly not, "Oh boy: Oscar for Best Actress, here I come!"<br /><br />Just another women in prison film like they used to make for the cheap in the '70s, this one actually has names you may recognize. XXXX Vernon plays the dean... I mean, the warden (with a hot tub in his office; wonder what he told the contractor?), XXXXXX Stevens pops up, even Henry Silva and Louisa Moritz show how bad they needed the work.<br /><br />And special mention, of course, for our heroine Sybil Danning as a bisexual prisoner who puts the moves on poor Blair. To paraphrase, XXXXX is as XXXXX does and everything XXXXX does is done perfect. Makes you forget what a terrible movie you're watching.<br /><br />Almost.<br /><br />Two stars. One for XXXXX and another for trying to pass off Linda Blair as a sex symbol. Whatever could have possessed them (get it?)?
