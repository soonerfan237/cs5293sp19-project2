Most people attending this film will have no idea of the great novel by XXXXXX XXXXXX that is the basis of it. It's a novel that should be read by more people to see how prejudice affects and alters peoples lives.<br /><br />At the beginning, XXXXXXXX XXXXXX is an ordinary man. The eyeglasses his boss makes him get change everything he has worked for and his whole world collapses around him, little by little. There couldn't have been an actor better suited to bring this intelligent performance to the screen than XXXXXXX XX XXXX. Not only is he a talented stage and screen actor, but he projects honesty behind every character he plays. He is an everyday man caught in his own insecurities. His anxiety intensifies when he takes a stand and walks out of his job. Suddenly, he has to confront the issues he has tried to avoid all his middle class existence in the Brooklyn of the 40s. Is he Jewish, is he not? The cinematography in this brilliant and atmospheric film, directed with sure hand by XXXX XXXXXX, kept reminding me of some XXXXXX XXXXXX's paintings, especially a sequence at the beginning of the film when XXXXXX steps outside a building and the night shot when he and his wife are being followed with long black shadows behind the couple, menacing and anticipating the confrontation with the bullies. XXXXX Dern, XXXXX XXXXXX, and especially XXXX XXXX, who infuses incredible depth to the bully-next-door, are excellent, but they all pale in comparison with the stellar turn of XXXXXXX XX XXXX (H must stand for HONEST..) If you haven't read the book, I would sincerely recommend it because no one has written more truly and convincingly than XXXXXX XXXXXX has.
