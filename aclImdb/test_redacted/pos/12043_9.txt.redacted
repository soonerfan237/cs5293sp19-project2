Darr (1993) was an incredible movie. In my opinion, it is one of XXXXXXXXX's finest. The movie itself triggers feelings of sympathy, fear, confusion, happiness, and sadness. XXXXXXXX's role was unbelievable, in fact he gave obsession a new face. XXXX XXXXXX's innocent and girlie character contrasted greatly with XXXXXXXX's fiery and passionate character. XXXXX Deol's role made the "good guy" role seem like the "bad guy" one. The fact that XXXXXXXX, not XXXXX, captivated the audience's attention proves that everyone has that helpless inner drive to pursue something that's not really in their hands. Even though the movie is several years old, it surpasses any recent one. The song "Tu Mere Samne" was full of passion and meaning. His personality fit the role perfectly. He should seriously consider re-starring in a similar film.
