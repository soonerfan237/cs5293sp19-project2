XXXXX De Vito shows us here he is definitely, indeed infinitely, a better on screen performer than off. He plays the part of Owen, a miserable would-be writer with a cranky old mother (delightfully played by XXXX Ramsey) he would like to see dead. XXXXX Crystal is Larry, a very frustrated writing teacher who has an estranged wife he feels the same way about. So XXXX, after viewing Hitchcock's "Strangers on a Train", suggests they swap murders.<br /><br />As director though, De Vito's control is inconsistent as he wastes this clever idea, while his film lurches from the very humorous to the very bland. He and Crystal are okay in the lead roles, but the show belongs to XXXX Ramsey as the cantankerous Mrs. Lift.<br /><br />Saturday, June 20, 1992 - Video
