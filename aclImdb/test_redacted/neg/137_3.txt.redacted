this is one of the more poorly made movies I've ever seen. One has to take anything by XXXXXXXX seriously; it's not just some B-movie cranked out by hacks.<br /><br />evidently XXXXXXXX couldn't decide whether he was making a noir or a sentimental chick flick. and neither could XXXXXXX, whose dozen (?) character flip-flops are simply unbelievable -- not even badly acted; just not acted at all. Among other things, how a woman as beautiful as XXXXXXX could be a person such as Julie/Marion is simply beyond anyone's ability to suspend disbelief; the role absolutely demands someone not so beautiful. Belmondo's acting also suffers although imho his character is not quite as unbelievable as XXXXXXX's. The clich√© ending (which I won't describe) is unfortunately all too appropriate for this complete mistake.
