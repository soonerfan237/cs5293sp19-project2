It has been recorded that XXXX XXXX made the "big, blockbuster" movies so that he could afford to make the "small" movies that he loved so well. XXXXX XXXXXX, with a young XXX XXXXXXX, is clearly one of his best, if not the best of his small movies. The location shooting, the wagons, the intricate work with horses, and the inclusion of the plains Indian are all trade marks of Ford. As in many of his other films, XXXXXXXXXX, the great Russian director's influence is seen in this film. The supporting cast including XXXX XXXX, Russell Simpson, and XXXX XXXXXXX are excellent as well as the many, minor character actors Ford used, including his brother (the one who plays the drums). While XXX XXXXXXX went on to win a well-deserved supporting XXXXX for The Last Picture Show, his co-star, XXXXX XXXXX,Jr. did not reach those heights. Although his father, XXXXX, Sr. became a western leading man in Ford's early films, XXXXX, Jr. spent most of his career in supporting roles. For fans of XXXX XXXX, and for fans of western films, this one is a must.
