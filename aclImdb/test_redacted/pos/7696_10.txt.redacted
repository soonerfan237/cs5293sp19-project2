"Porgy and Bess" is an outstanding production of XXXXXX XXXXXXXX's masterpiece. It is tastefully done in muted colors. The voices are outstanding. Although XXXXXX XXXXXXX's voice is dubbed for his singing portion, he gives a very touching performance. There is a remarkable performance by XXXXX XXXXX Jr. as XXXXXXX XXXX. There is yet no DVD available for viewing, and this piece begs for one. All intelligent movie goers who enjoyed it in 1959 will appreciate the release of this masterpiece on the new medium. The screen is filled with a dynamic presentation that rivals all other musicals including the outstanding ones by Rodgers and Hammerstein. Be sure to ask for it an your video supplier. Like "Songs of the South" by XXXX XXXXXX, it may be the assumption of racial overtones that is preventing the marketing of this cinema.
