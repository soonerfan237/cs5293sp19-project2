by TyNesha Mells. In this drama, XX Rule, who stars as Reggie, struggles with the loss of his father. His old friend J-Bone, who is a cold-blooded thug recently released from prison, helps XXXXXX find who murdered his father. A week after his dad died, a preacher, XXXXXXXX Packer, came up dead. XXXXXX was suppose to be the one to kill him, but did he? XXX Reggie kill Reverend Packer or was it some type of a setup? Back in the Day also has a couple of romantic scenes. See, XXXXXX falls in love with the preacher's daughter and J-Bone doesn't approve of his love fiend. As J-Bone tries to destroy what they have, XXXXXX learns that love is about forgiveness. But what J-bone is doing, does it work? Do XXXXXX and his girlfriend break up, or does it bring them closer together? I like this movie because it leaves you wondering what's going to happen next and did this or that happen. I like movies with suspense! It kind of makes you want to be in the movie so that you could detect things. I also like this movie because everything falls in place, if you really pay attention to it!
