One has to take XXXXXX & Lewis like a dash of salt & pepper. Why does XXXXXX put up with Lewis? Then again, why do all the women in this movie like XXXXX? Because he is innocently likeable! XXXXXX sings a few good songs (lip-sync'd at least once) and Jerry manages to kiss more girls than in all his other movies combined. I generally find that I can take just so much of XXXXX's antics before they become aggravating. BUT.... in this film, watch when XXXXX gets stuck outside on a submerging Navy submarine! EXCELLENT! XXXXXX Keaton should have been proud. I give the film a 7.
