I really enjoyed watching XXXX to Pay. I've been a fan of Westerns for as long as I can remember and this one reminded me of a lot of the Westerns from the 1960s (even though I was too young to have seen them in their first run). The one thing that bothered me about the movie was the constant music. It was distracting at times. One thing I did notice, and I wonder how many other fans of XXXXXXXX noticed, was the name of Buck Taylor's character. It was a play on XXX Adams' name from Gunsmoke. Instead of XXXXXX Adams, Buck Taylor used Adam Galen. I wonder if that was his choice or XXXXX McIntyre's? Anyway, I would recommend this movie to fans of Westerns. Don't expect anything too "deep". Just plain old entertainment.
