XXXXX Lang directed two great westerns: "Western Union" and "The Return of Frank James". The Frank James movie equals "XXXXX James". "Western Union" is one of XXXXXXXX Scott's great westerns. I have never seen XXXXXX Young in a western before; he is terrific as the telegraph employee. This is the only movie I can think of that is about the telegraph company opening up in the west. It is a high-geared story about the telegraph in the west, a triangle love story, and about loyalty. <br /><br />The supporting cast is superb. XXXX Jagger, who made a few westerns, plays the telegraph manager. Virginia Gilmore, who plays XXX Jagger's sister, is the love interest in the movie. Ms. XXXXXXX had a short career in movies. She quit films in 1952 and became a drama coach. She is primarily known as the first Mrs. Yul Brynner. It is great to see XXXX Summerville in a movie with Mr. Scott again. They were in two other great movies: "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm" and "XXXXX James".
