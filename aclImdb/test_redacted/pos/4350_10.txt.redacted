XXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXX To XXX is another in the remarkable body of XXXXXX XXXXXX's filmic work that is without peer. Having recently rewatched it on DVD, nearly a decade after its initial US release in 1997, it has lost none of its power, and one can see its influence on documentaries as diverse as XXXXXX's own recent XXXXXXX XXX and XXXXX XXXXXX's XXXXXXX XXXXX winning The Fog Of War. Like the former, it details, in its far too brief 74 minutes, the life of an interesting American. Like the latter it gives a peek at a side of war that few see. Yes, we see the violence and the heroism, but as The Fog Of War brought us into the mind of one of last century's foremost warmongers, this film allows us a peek at the life of a grunt who is captured by the enemy, tortured, and ultimately triumphs. Except, in no way, shape, nor form, is the film as simplistic nor upbeat as my brief description of it. Nor is XXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXX To XXX's titular subject, XXXXXX XXXXXXX, and immigrant German who survived the depredations of the Nazis (we find out, as example, that in his hometown, XXXXXXXX, in the Black Forest, his grandfather was the only man not to vote for XXXXXX, and suffered brutally for that stand) post-World War Two Germany, and his own imprisonment at the hands of the Vietcong, when his Air Force jet was shot down over Laos on February 1st, 1966Â…. While the title of the film, and the idea of XXXXXXX's passion for becoming a pilot, stirred by the impression Allied fighter planes made on him when they razed his town, as a child, make one believe that XXXXXXX is the central subject of the film, this is not true. The subject is XXXXXXX's survival, or, more precisely, his human will, all human will. The details of XXXXXXX's romantic life are too XXXXXXXXX and staid an aspect to interest XXXXXX. Nor is the fact that he won a Purple Heart, XXXXX of Honor, the D.F.C., and the Navy Cross. That thing which pushed XXXXXXX to survive so much, and remain such a relatively upbeat man (although there are glimpses of darker sides), is what is at the center of this film, and all of XXXXXX's canon. XXXXXX XXXXXXX's 'distant barbaric dream' of his past is fully ripened XXXXXX Country, and the use of a Madagascan chant, XXX XXXX X, during many jungle scenes, among other excellent touches in the score, show XXXXXX is, perhaps along with only XXXXXX XXXXXXXX, the best manipulator of image and music in film. Long may he merge!
