A clever overall story/location for a story. Action is respectable. The children are annoying and their motivation is unclear. The leading villain was a nice change but could have been better. "I Love You" was more overplayed than "you complete me" but at least XXX Damme got a chance to show a little tenderness. One of XXX Damme's better movies.
