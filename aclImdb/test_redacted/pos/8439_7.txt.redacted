This is a pretty good thriller at a nuclear power plant in southern California that was directed by XXXXX XXXXXXX and stars XXXX XXXXX, XXXX XXXXXX and XXXXXXX XXXXXXX. XXXXX plays a TV reporter who wants to be an investigative journalist but is only allowed to be a TV reporter. XXXXXXX is an independent cameraman and XXXXXX is a supervisor at a nuclear plant. XXXXX and XXXXXXX are sent on a routine assignment at a nuclear power plant and an accident almost happens and they get it all on film. Everyone tries to cover it up except XXXXX and XXXXXXX, so XXXXXXX steals the film. XXXXXX starts to investigate and finds out the company cares more about profit then safety at the plant. It's a good movie with a pretty good ending.
