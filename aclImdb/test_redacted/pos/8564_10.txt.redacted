I gave this a 10 because it's the best film of its kind...a good old-fashioned T & A film in the shadow and spirit of "XXXXXX XXXXX." I saw this with a similar film called "XXXX XXXX" and both were good of their type...a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. Let's be honest...there are more breasts in this movie than one could imagine for an R-rated movie. From beginning to end, they just seem to keep showing up on screen (sunbathing scenes, bedroom scenes and, of course, the climactic football game). Also, a memorable kissing booth (kiss me, XXXXX!) Everybody seems to be having a good time in their roles (several XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX, XXXXX XXXXXXXX, several familiar TV and movie actors, etc.). The only complaint I have to register is that XXXX XXXXXX's character is called by her last name "O'Hara" and not a good 1970s name like "Olivia" (or even Ora or Ona or O...??!!). I saw this again in the late 1980s with my now ex-wife (pretty well endowed herself) and she couldn't believe I was actually enjoying the movie!! She was probably jealous!! Again, this movie is a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon...just don't think too hard!
