XXXXX XXXXXXX is XXXXX, a writer who hasn't written and is suspected of murder in "XXXXX XXXXX from the Train," costarring XXXXX XXXXXX and XXXX XXXXXX. The phrase "black comedy" was invented for this insanity, which is a take-off on XXXXXXXXX's "Strangers on a Train." In fact, XXXX (Devito) gets the idea of having XXXXX kill his mother in exchange for XXXX killing XXXXX's ex from watching that famous film. "I saw the movie. Criss-cross," XXXX tells XXXXX. Not that XXXXX knows what he's talking about until it appears it's too late - just like "Strangers." XXXXX, a writing teacher, claims that his ex-wife, played by Kate Mulgrew, stole his book and put her name on it. She has become a big celebrity, appearing on "XXXXX," where she refers to XXXXX as "a beast." XXXX is in XXXXX's class. He lives with an abusive Neanderthal mother (Ramsey) and has visions of poisoning her, sticking a scissors in her head - you name it. It's not long after seeing "Strangers on a Train" that he's in Honolulu, stalking XXXXX's wife. While she's leaning over a boat railing trying to get an earring, XXXX stands behind her and creeps up...Soon the police are looking for XXXXX to question him, but he's at XXXX's where he's being encouraged to live up to his end of a bargain he had no idea he made. You know, "criss-cross." There are several scenes copied from "Strangers," which are hilarious. I especially loved XXXXX's confession to the sleeping Mrs. Lift, XXXX's mother, similar to when XXX thinks he's talking to XXXXX's stepfather.<br /><br />XXXXXXX and DeVito are complete masters of comic dialogue and timing and will leave you laughing, often out loud. Ramsey is repulsively funny - a totally "out there" performance. XXX Griest and XXX XXXXXX also have roles - Griest is XXXXXXX's girlfriend, and XXXXXX has what amounts to a cameo.<br /><br />The ending is very clever, and the whole film will leave you laughing.
