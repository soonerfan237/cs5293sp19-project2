I have to agree that the movie is not the best I've ever seen, but I would like to make mention that the actors portraying XXXXX and Jimmy Dorsey were the actual Dorsey brothers. As actors, they were wonderful musicians. The movie, based on their famous split, would have been better had professional actors played the parts. Many movies made during this time frame took advantage of the popularity of Big Bands. Most often, the movies were not that good because musicians are not actors by trade. Most of the movie-going audience didn't go to see XXXXX or Jimmy Dorsey playing themselves; they went for the plot and the music. I've never been much of a Dorsey fan, but the music is good even today.<br /><br />I have to comment on a previous post regarding the actors who played XXX and Pop Dorsey and that their accents would be considered extreme by a Dublin audience. XXXXXX Shields and Sara Allgood were actually Irish actors, both born in Dublin. You might remember XXX Shields as the Reverend XXX Playfair in The Quiet Man and Ms. Allgood as Mrs. Monahan in Cheaper By The Dozen.
