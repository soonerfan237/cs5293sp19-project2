Then XXXXXX's greatest fear happens, XXXXXX goes missing. XXXXXX visits the young lady XXXXXX was with the night he was attacked. She tells him about the drawings. The drawings have been stolen. She says only one man came in during the time XXXXXX left, to fix the light-bulb. The man she describes is Professor XXXXXXXX. He is working for the Nazi's. Seen as he has the drawings, XXXXXX is done for. But he finds the writing pad he used and using Science, he manages to see what XXXXXX drew by looking at the next page on the pad. He sees it's code. He sees it's the name of four scientists. The first three he works out the code for, but he can't work out the fourth. The three scientists he has worked out have been murdered and the bomb-site has been taken. XXXXXX can't work out the fourth scientist, but neither can XXXXXXXX. Disguised as a sailor, XXXXXX manages to get in XXXXXXXX's office. XXXXXXXX sees straight away it's XXXXXX, puts him in a box and has him thrown in the sea.

XXXXXX gets round to his house straight away and get XXXXXXX and the decisive fourth part to safety. XXXXXX now needs to get XXXXXXXX charged for working with the Nazi's. He pretends to be XXXXXXX. XXXXXXXX works out the fourth code and gets two men to go round and get XXXXXXX. They take him back and he comes face to face with XXXXXXXX. Meanwhile XXXXXX is not in a good way, he has been tortured and tortured to get the name of the fourth scientist. XXXXXXXX has had it with XXXXXX now, he has got him and his death must be a long one for XXXXXX. The idea is to put him in his hospital, put a needle in his vein and watch him die of blood loss, drop by drop. XXXXXX runs in and saves the day though. XXXXXXXX gets away, but XXXXXX was only careless enough to leave XXXXXXXX's trap door open. XXXXXXXX plunges sixty feet.<br /><br />So, XXXXXXXX dead. No. He makes his final outing in the film 'The Woman in Green' but in 'Green' he is definitely dead, a suicide, he jumps off his roof. It was XXXXXXXX's second of three appearances in the Rathbone series, a different actor playing him on each occasion. His first appearance in 'The Adventures of Sherlock XXXXXX' was played by XXXXXX XXXXX, his second in this film he was played by Lionell Atwill and XXXXX XXXXXXX plays him in his final outing in 'The Woman in Green' The first three XXXXXX films made by XXXXXXXXX were set in the war as XXXXXX triumphs over the Nazi's. 'The Voice of XXXXXX' was the first, then this film and then 'Sherlock XXXXXX In Washington' Then it was back to Victorianish times, with definite relations to Edwardian and Georgian (George the fifth and sixth) times. This film had a close link to the Sherlock XXXXXX short story 'The Dancing XXX' which can be found in 'The Return of Sherlock XXXXXX' A great film, though obvious propaganda, it was a brilliant XXXXXX outing.
