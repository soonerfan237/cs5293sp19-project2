I have seen quite a few action thrillers in my life and this is clearly one of the best ever! There are very few films which I even consider watching several times and this is one of them. Everything in this movie is just right: XXXXX as the superb leading actor, XXXX XXXXX as his non-stupid female partner(this is a very rare combination - sad,but true!). Of course, XXXX XXXXXXXXX deserves a lot of praise for his excellent villain but let us not overlook XXXXXXXX`s initial buddy, played by XXXXX XXXXXXXXX, who in my view fits the role perfectly.The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic - but sadly never released on an original soundtrack CD (shame on the producers!). The plot makes sense and there is no loss of pace, the audience is kept in constant excitement of the outcome of the duel between XXXXXXXX and Malkowich. I give this one 10 Stars!
