This is the forty minute film that introduces us to the character of the Butcher, who will later be examined more thoroughly in the feature XXXX XXXXXX XXXX. In this film, it follows the early period of his life from 1965-1979, but focusing on the late seventies. The first images are of a slaughter of a horse, then the birth of a baby, the Butcher's daughter, who we quickly see growing up each year. The Butcher (played by XXXXXXXX XXXXX in both films) is a man bitter with the world. He hates many things. His anger comes to a head when a man assaults his autistic daughter. The Butcher then maims the wrong man, and finds himself in prison.<br /><br />This film follows the butcher's life to just after his release from prison, then XXXX XXXXXX XXXX takes over from there. I watched the films the wrong way about, XXXX XXXXXX XXXX first. Try and watch this little film first if you can.
