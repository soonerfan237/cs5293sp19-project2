Though predictable and contrived, not a bad movie. It entertains, which is all XXX Damme hopes to do. The omnipresent "twin" device is again used (as in a large number of XXX Damme's movies) but it is not bothersome except to long time fans. Natasha is gorgeous and worth watching. Action is decent, nothing spectacular for XXX Damme but exciting. I can recommend to XXX Damme fans and even to those who aren't but don't mind an action film with a good looking lead couple. The Russian Mob is a nice concept and topical for the day. Clearly, not his best film but by no means his worst.
