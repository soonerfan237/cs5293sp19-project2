Based on a XXXXXXX King novel, NEEDFUL THINGS provides the intrigue and eeriness to keep you in your seat. A mysterious man(Max von Sydow) comes to town and soon becomes the most talked about citizen. Could it be that the devil himself has set up shop as an antique dealer in a small town in Maine? von XXXXX is masterful and dynamic in this role that dominates the screen. Also starring are XX Harris and Bonnie Bedelia. Harris is steady and Bedelia is deserving of your attention. Also in support are J.T. Walsh and XXXXXX Plummer. Not the best, nor the worst adaptation of King's horror on the screen.
