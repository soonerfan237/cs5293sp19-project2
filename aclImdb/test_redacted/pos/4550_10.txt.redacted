I've watched this movie on a fairly regular basis for most of my life, and it never gets old. For all the snide remarks and insults (mostly from XXXXX Spade), "Tommy Boy" has a giant heart. And that's what keeps this movie funny after all these years.<br /><br />XXXXX Callahan (Chris Farley) is the son of Big Tom Callahan (Brian Dennehy), master car parts salesman, and has ridden on that all his life. But after his died dies on his wedding day, XXXXX learns that the company is in debt, and about to be bought by Ray Zalinsky (Dan Akroyd), the owner of a huge car parts company. So in order to save the company, XXXXX has to go on the road to sell the company's new brake pads. Along for the ride, though not by choice, is XXXXXXX Hayden (David Spade) a former classmate of Tommy's who was Big Tom's right-hand man.<br /><br />The movie rides on the chemistry between the two SNL stars (and real-life best friends) Chris Farley and David Spade. The duo has enough comic energy going between them to power the world. It's the big, dumb guy versus the smart little guy. It works, and some of their scenes are unforgettably funny. Farley and Spade are actually decent dramatic actors as well. Although the film is primarily a comedy, it has its fair share of drama, but XXXXX and especially Farley are just as good there as when they're making the audience laugh.<br /><br />Forgive me, but I have to talk about Chris Farley a little more. I read his biography ("The XXXXX Farley Show: A Biography in Three Acts," for anyone who cares), and understanding who XXXXX was in real life made this movie more special to me. XXXXX Farley was a genuinely good person who struggled, and ultimately failed to conquer his addictions. Although this was the first movie he had a major role in, it is his best film. It really showed who he was, and just how much talent he had. Knowing XXXXX's story adds another layer to this movie, although it doesn't make it any less funny.<br /><br />Farley and Spade are matched with a good on screen cast. XXX Lowe is suitably slimy as Tommy's "new brother," and Bo Derek is solid as his step-mother. Brian XXXXXXX is great as Big Tom. Dennehy makes it easy to believe that they're father in son. Big Tom is just as crazy as his son, although he's smarter and more mature. XXX Akroyd gives one of his best performances as Zalinsky, giving Tommy the hard truth behind advertising. XXXXX Warner is also good as Tommy's love interest, Michelle.<br /><br />For me, Peter Segal is one of the great comedy directors. He keeps the pace quick and energetic, but most importantly, he knows how to make comedy funny. He doesn't belabor the jokes, and he understands that funny actors know what they're doing and he allows them to do it. But XXXXX goes a step further. He gives "XXXXX Boy" a friendly, almost nostalgic tone that both tugs the heartstrings (genuinely) and tickles the funnybone.<br /><br />Critics didn't like "XXXXX Boy." Shame on them. A movie doesn't have to be super sophisticated or subversively intellectual to be funny (God forbid XXXXXX and Spade were forced to do muted comedy a la "The Office"). This is a great movie and one of my all-time favorites.
