Out of all the Bat-films, XXXXXX XXXXXXX is my favorite. This beautiful, dark, and funny film is one of XXX XXXXXX's best work. Although it is much violent and darker, this is the XXXXXX that creator XXX XXXX envisioned many years ago. XXXXXXX XXXXXX reprises his role as the avenger of XXXXXX XXXX. This time he's up against two deadly foes, XXXXX XXXXXX's Penguin and XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX's Catwoman. With a great cast and film score by XXXXX XXXXXX, the movie takes us on an adventure as XXXXXX battles the evil forces that are trying to take over XXXXXX XXXX. XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXX makes a great appearance as XXX XXXXX, a shrewd businessman who has an evil scheme up his sleeve. But of course, XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX is the one that steals the show. With all of these components, you have a film that will blow you away. This is the reason why you go to the movies. It's got everything. It's really a shame that XXX XXXXXX didn't get to direct the other sequels. If so I think the franchise would still be going strong today. XXXXXX XXXXXXX is an awesome experience for fans that like cool movies.
