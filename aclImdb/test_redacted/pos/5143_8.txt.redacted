In 'Hoot' XXXXX Lerman plays Roy Eberhardt, the new kid in school who has just moved from Montana. But XXXXXXX is a lot different from Montana. Despite is troubles in blending in, XXX discovers a bigger problem. A new franchise restaurant is coming to town and families of burrowing owls are in trouble. Can the new kid, a tomboy (XXXX Larson) and a runaway (Cody Linley) stop big business from destroying these owls' home? <br /><br />This movie was pretty good. The kids (XXXXX Lerman, Brie Larson and Cody Linley) are the real stars of this film. XXXX Wilson (Officer Delinko) is okay, but really does not have a very big part. Neither does XXXXXX Wagner (Mayor) or Jimmy Buffett (Mr. Ryan).<br /><br />Nevertheless this was a fun film that the whole family will enjoy. For a first time producer, I thought XXXXX Buffett put together a quality piece of work. Plus the owls were really cute.
