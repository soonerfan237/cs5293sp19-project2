XXXX Leguizamo is a great comedian and storyteller. Every time this has been on HBO I've had to stop and watch it. XXXX tells the story of how he grew up (probably some fact and fiction) and adds hilarious stories in the midst. If you like XXXX's comedy I would have to say this is probably his comedy at his best.
