Just Go see this movie. It taps into everything awesome about rock and roll, the band comes up with some great songs (Classico, XXXX of Destiny, XXXXXX XXXXXXXX etc). All this with the Humor of Teancous D makes this the best movie ever.<br /><br />The Cameos are great right of the back, with XXXX XXXX and XXX singing to JB. XXX Stiller and XXX XXXXXXX are great, I really like XXX XXXXXXX character. You also find out who XXXXX really is! The Music and Musical references are hilarious and XXXXXXX. Playin songs great songs from The Who, XXX, and others just complete it. i personally didn't think the band could top the awesome songs of the D, but they did with songs like Classico and XXXXXX XXXXXXXX. Seriously awesome music.<br /><br />Just go see it, its a must for anyone who loves rock!
