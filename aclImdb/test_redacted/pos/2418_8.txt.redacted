I thought this movie was great, if you didn't take it too seriously. Just sit back and enjoy XXXXXX Swank in all her greatness and laugh when the monks go to Boston, MA. I also think this movie has a great message about self control and inner strength. Plus XXX Myagi was so sweet, I wish he'd teach me karate!
