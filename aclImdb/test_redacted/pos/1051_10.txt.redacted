"XXXXXXXXX In Connecticut" is a gem of a XXXXXXXXX movie classic. While lesser known than some others -- it is nonetheless a delightful way to spend an evening at holiday time. I watch it every year.<br /><br />XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX is perfectly cast as, XXXXXXXXX XXXX, the single, career girl. Way before it was popular, XXXXXXXX embodies the single girl on the rise. Her NYC apartment, and her friendly "uncle" restaurateur around the corner typify the single girl in the city existence. She can't cook yet she writes a homemaking column for a magazine!<br /><br />XXXXXX XXXXXX is also perfectly cast as our wartime hero, XXXXXXXXX XXXXX, who wants to meet the amazing XXXXXXXXX XXXX. After being lost at sea, all he wants is to spend XXXXXXXXX in a "real" home. Which sets up the delightful, madcap story that evolves. It is fun from beginning to end. We should all have an XXXXX XXXXX too!
