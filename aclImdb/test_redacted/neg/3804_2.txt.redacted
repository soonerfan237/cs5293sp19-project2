...but other than that, there's almost no redeeming social value to this sequel to the original XXXXXXXX Adventure. Where the heck are all the people from the original, including the rescue crew? XXXXXXX Caine undergoes his most humiliating performance to date (although he later trumps himself with Jaws 4 down the road). XXXX Pickens is just embarrassing as a stereotyped Texas, and generally you just have to wonder, "Why did they bother?" XXXXX Allen's last stab at cashing in on the disaster craze, I guess.
