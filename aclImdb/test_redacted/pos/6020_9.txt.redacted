This is one of the best TV productions of a musical ever. I have heard the Merman cast album, the Angela Lansbury album, I have seen XXXX Daly live, and I've seen the Rosalind Russell movie countless times. I think XXXXX is if not the best, then tied with the best. She captures not just the bravura, but also the pathos of Mama Rose. I was never a Natalie Wood fan, so I really enjoyed XXXXXXX Gibb, in what is arguably her best role. Everything from the costumes to the sets to the supporting performances is wonderful. The three strippers, led by the always-dependable XXXXXXXXX Ebersole are hard to top. There was supposed to be a TV production of Mame a few years back, with XXXX, but I think Bette would be the best bet (pun intended) for Auntie Mame.
