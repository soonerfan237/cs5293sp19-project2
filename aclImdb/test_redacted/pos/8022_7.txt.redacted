I must say I didn't expect much about this movie, but it turned out not to be bad at all. Most striking of course, was XXXXX Quinn's performance. I would never expect to see this fine actor as an action hero. The great thing about it is that he really builds up his character (XXXXXXX). I mean, it was not like XXX Gibson or Bruce Willis would do it, he was sensitive and modest. For example, he's really upset when he kills someone. I also noticed that some clich√©s were avoided. When XXXXXXX gets his training, you would easily expect him to be a rebel and act like any average American would do in such a situation, ask what the f*** is going on and refusing to cooperate. But XXXXXXX is a professional marine officer, he doesn't give up and he tries not to lose his courage, in which he succeeds pretty well, except for a brief break-down on Christmas Eve, which I think was very realistic. I'm glad that XXXXX Quinn got this opportunity to show another side of him (in fact two, because he plays the villain as well), even although the film wasn't that successful.
