I have always liked XXXX Murray in films like Lost in Translation, and the trailer for this film looked really good, but the result was very disappointing. Basically XXXXXX plays Jack Corcorin who has recently found out that his father died, and he is expected to hear his will. He finds out that his father was a clown, because he left a large shoe, his squeaky nose, and his main inheritance, an elephant! The only way that XXXX can get rid of this elephant is to travel 4000 miles in four days and give him to a safe zoo for $30,000. Also starring XXX Hingle as Vernon. There are small tiny moments of humour, such as a truck's front bending forward, and Murray screaming, but overall, it's pointless. Pretty poor!
