The funniest movie from Britain I have ever seen, "The Supergrass" is a tale of sex, drugs, cream teas, and murder by the seaside. XXXXXX Carter (XXXXXX XXXXXXXX), average moron, is out to impress his so-called girlfriend, XXXXXX (Dawn French), because she thinks he is too law-abiding. So, to get her to come along with him on a romantic getaway, he comes up with a scheme that perhaps will impress her and entice her to spend some time with him. Trouble is, XXXXXX' lie is that he's somehow gotten involved in an international drugs ring, and while telling her, a couple of policemen overhear his boasting and nick him. And so begins this witty movie, full of slick comedy and crude jokes. XXXXXX is banged up in the local nick, and, much to the arresting officers' delight, there seems to be no way out (XXXXXX's earlier attempts to explain it was all a lie were dismissed by a hilarious melody of "Stand by Your Man" by the two officers'). Then comes along Commander Robertson (XXXXXX XXXXX), Chief Intelligence, Scotland Yard. He makes a deal with XXXXXX, that if he helps him catch the drug smugglers, then he will be set free and allowed whatever he pleases. XXXXXX agrees, and is teamed up with XXXXXX XXXXXX (XXXXX XXXXXXXXXX), and XXXXXX XXXXXXXX (Jennifer Saunders). The rest is an unforgettable rib-tickling experience, with XXXXXX XXXXXXXX as Sergeant Troy adding humourous colour to the film. His walk along the dry-dock against "XXXXXXX XXXX To XXXXXXXXX's Two Tribes" is superb, and probably the best scene in motion picture history. The two officers' who nick XXXXXX are wonderfully played by XXXXXXX XXXXXXX and XXXXXXX XXXXXX, and XXXXXX XXXXX as the motorcycle cop is a laugh! If you want something good to watch on a Saturday night, then I suggest you rent this. You won't forget it!
