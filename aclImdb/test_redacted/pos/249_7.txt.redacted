XXXX XXXXXXXX as XXXXX XXXXXX is the COVER GIRL du jour--she's one of the dancing girls in XXXXX XXXXXXX's club, the most special one according to XXXXX (XXXX XXXXX) and pretty much anyone who comes across her. Take for example, Vanity magazine magnate XXXX XXXXXXX (Otto Kruger): enchanted by Rusty's resemblance to her grandmother XXXXXXXXX (also played by XXXXXXXX in flashbacks), whom he wooed devotedly when he fell in love with her, he tries to relive his youth by fixing what he thinks went wrong between himself and XXXXXXXXX. He doesn't believe that XXXXX could give Rusty happiness, or everything she should be entitled to--he even gets XXXXX believing this himself. When Rusty shoots to fame as Vanity's 'Cover Girl', XXXXX drives her away into the ready and waiting arms of Noel XXXXXXX (XXX XXXXXX). So what happens when XXXXX returns to town with his sidekick Genius (XXXX XXXXXXX) in tow, only to discover that Rusty is marrying XXXXXXX?<br /><br />As a musical, COVER GIRL benefits from the beautiful score and songs written by XXXXXX XXXX and Ira Gershwin, including the Oscar-nominated 'Long XXX and XXX XXXX' (possibly one of the most gorgeous ballads ever written and beautifully, sweetly sung as a duet by XXXXXXXX and XXXXX), XXXXXXXXX's number 'Sure Thing' (the more lacklustre 'Poor XXXX' isn't a Kern/Gershwin collaboration) and 'Put Me To The Test'. The dancing, of course, is top-notch, since XXXX XXXXX had more than just a hand in the choreography. It shows in the simplest of dances, for example his dance with XXXXXXXX to 'Put Me To The Test', or the joyfully exuberant 'Make Way For XXXXXXXX' number (performed by the trio of XXXXX, Rusty and Genius)... which foreshadows the reaction XXXX's character has to the police cop in the title number in SINGIN' IN THE RAIN. XXXXX especially scored a technological and artistic coup with the 'Alter-Ego' dance. Like its successors in ANCHORS AWEIGH and AN AMERICAN IN PARIS (XXXXX the Mouse and the 16-minute ballet respectively), this dance is an example of the incredible innovation and creativity XXXXX brought to the modern film musical: wanting to use the film medium to present dances that couldn't be showcased on a stage, and years before CGI, XXXXX insisted on dancing with the one person who could possibly match him in talent and style--himself. The number is hardly five minutes long, but it (and XXXXX's genius) still takes one's breath away, even sixty years down the line. This is the reason I watched COVER GIRL, and if nothing else, this dance is truly worth it.<br /><br />You can tell that a great deal of money was lavished onto COVER GIRL and XXXX XXXXXXXX--not that she doesn't deserve it. Witness the scene when Rusty hits XXXXXXXX--the large screen showcasing all the different cover girls gives way to a staggeringly large stage rigged for Rusty's entrance. XXXXXXXX is indeed one of the most effortlessly beautiful girls on show in the film, and she dances with a style and grace that is almost worthy of XXXXX. (Very few of XXXXX's co-stars have that honour.) She is hilarious in some scenes, for example her drunk scene when XXXX and XXXXXXX come to get her from Joe's.<br /><br />For some reason, however, her performance still lacks the spark of greatness which would help COVER GIRL overcome its general curse of mediocrity. That curse is only lifted whenever XXXX XXXXX is on the screen (dancing or no), or when XXX XXXXX as XXXX's long-suffering secretary 'Stonewall' sidles by with another cutting comment or clever observation. Since the film, in the end, belongs to XXXXXXXX, neither XXXXX nor XXXXX can save it as a whole. This isn't to say that the film is bad--it isn't. It's enjoyable, with great songs and cute numbers and lots of pretty girls to look at. But it's just not quite a classic. The dancing is classic though--so watch COVER GIRL for that, and you won't regret it.
