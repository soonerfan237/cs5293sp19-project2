This film was made soon enough after XXXXX's passing that perhaps XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX and the people closest to XXXXX were feeling a little guilty as to how they may have contributed to her health problems. As the years have passed (almost 25 to be exact) it must have gotten easier to deny any complicity. XXXXXXX has spent the years after XXXXX's death endlessly remixing and recompiling the recordings he made with her. He married his cousin, XXXX, and from what I have read, it looks like he may be planning a next generation Carpenters with his children. He seems to have regretted making this film,and that may very well be why it is unavailable in any form. It seemed to me to be a fairly honest assessment of the tragically short life and incredible talent that was XXXXX Carpenter.
