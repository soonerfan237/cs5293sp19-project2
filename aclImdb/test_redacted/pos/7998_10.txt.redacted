This sequel proves that XXX XXXXXX was for all intents and purposes THE best choice to ever direct a Batman movie. The story focuses on Baman taking on three enemies: The Penguin (wonderfully played by XXXXX XXXXXX) Catwoman (the slinky XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX) and XXX XXXXXX (the superb XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXX).<br /><br />Perhaps the best entry in the series, it has it all: complex themes, complex characters and a dark tone that truly stands out. The cast is simply wonderful although the obvious stand-out is DeVito as the multi-layered Penguin. Here is a guy who is evil, pitiable, funny and perhaps most importantly, scary. The infamous scene with XXXXXX's image consultants still sends shivers up my spine. In other words, the cast is simply a joy to watch and all turn in first rate performances.<br /><br />I do not hesitate to say that "XXXXXX XXXXXXX" is my favorite of all the Batmans released (sorry, XXXX XXXXXX fans). If you want a superhero film that has a little more to offer besides flashy effects and big scale action, then please check out this badly underrated film. <br /><br />If nothing else, it's at least the best film XXX XXXXXX has ever made.
