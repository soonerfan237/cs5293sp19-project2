This was the first Chan film made by XXXXXXXX. What a come down from XXX values and standards! I was shocked when I saw my first Monogram after seeing the great XXX films. This is boring and uninspired with wild music playing as XXXX calmly walks across the street. XXXX is now working for the US Secret Service rather than the Honolulu Police Department. He is assisted by XXXXXX Fong, who plays No. 3 XXX Tommy for the first time. He also has a daughter along, XXXX Chan, played by Marianne Quon. Mantan Moreland also makes his debut as XXXXXXXXXX Brown. He is a cab driver in Washington, DC, here, rather than the later chauffeur to Chan in the later films.
