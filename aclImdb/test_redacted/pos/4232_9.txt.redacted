I´m from germany so please excuse my style of writing. As I´ve seen XXXXXX 4 for the first time I was a bit surprised, I knew XXXXXX as a usual 80s scarymovie, but Bride of XXXXXX was very different from the old ones. First there is the artwork of the very good director XXXXX Yu, who we still have in mind from A chinese ghost story. His visual style is in a wired kinda way comparable to XXXXXXX Ford Coppola. Also the voices of Chucky an Tiff are very impressive. I´ve also liked the screenplay very much, especially the scene in which Tiff throws the Champaignbottle in the ceilingmirror.<br /><br />I give it a 9.0 vote for funny, gory and progressive entertainment. If you have any comments on my opinion, just send me an E-Mail. MFG Schawez
