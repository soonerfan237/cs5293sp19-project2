For a brief moment. The opening scene with XXXXX Lords and the<br /><br />techno bar is incredible. I'd probably follow her to my ultimate death too! Best vampire movie of all time but with a twist. The fight scenes are awesome. XXXXXX Snipes displays an athleticism you dont get to see every day. And XXXXXXX Dorff is impressive and very believable as an ambitious new recruit moving himself up the hierarchy by any means necessary. Great flick 9/10. Where's XXXXX II?
