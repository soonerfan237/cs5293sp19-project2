XXXX to believe this was directed by Fritz Lang since he mostly directed crime dramas and mysteries. This movie has a cast that includes XXXXXX Young, Randolph Scott, Dean Jagger and John Carradine. XXXXX plays an outlaw who tries to go straight and leave his old gang and winds up saving Jagger's life. Jagger works for Western Union, a telegraph company that plans to have telegraphs out west. Jagger hires a lot of men to make sure it is done because they have to worry about Indian attacks and bandits. Scott is in charge of the men and XXXXX is a telegraph expert who can't shoot a gun but can ride. XXXXX meets up with his old gang who want to stop them but XXXXX can't tell anyone. It's a pretty good western and XXXX should of directed some more westerns.
