I must tell you the truth. The only reason I wanted to see this movie was because of XXXX XXXXXXX. I think that part definitely worked out...pretty well actually. However, the film was very good too. Some parts of this movie are really good.<br /><br />The film has great action also. The mystery is pretty hard to figure out and XXXX [McGowan] does some "Oscar-worthy" acting towards the end of the film, but I don't want to give anything away. XXXX Beach and XXXXXX XXXXXXXX are also great in the movie, along with some of the other stars.<br /><br />If you like mysteries, or action movies, or just like XXXX...I totally think you would like this movie.
