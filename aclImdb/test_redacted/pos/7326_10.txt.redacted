XXXXXXXXX Studios version of "Flipper" (1996) is a great heartwarming film for the entire family with good values and sentimentality. It is the story of XXXXX XXXXX, a teenager from Chicago who reluctantly spends his vacation with his Uncle XXXXXX XXXXX in the Bahamas. This ultimately changes the teenagers life and he grows up in the process. He learns to appreciate nature and to have a respect for the environment. I grew up in the 1960's and the NBC television show "Flipper" was my favorite childhood show. XXXXXX XXXX is perfectly cast as a 1990's XXXXX XXXXX and gives an excellent performance. As much as I liked the NBC television show and MGM theatrical feature films with XXXX XXXXXX as XXXXX in the 1960's I liked this feature the best! I feel XXXXXX XXXX is the best XXXXX XXXXX. With respect to XXXX XXXXXX I feel XXXXXX XXXX has more of a range of acting talent and emotes more as an actor which makes his performance excellent and more believable. I think XXXXXX XXXX is the best young actor working today in films. XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXX also wrote the screenplay and has done an excellent job as both writer and director of this film. XXXX XXXXX gives a comical and likable performance as XXXXX's Uncle XXXXXX XXXXX. XXX XXXXX's performance perfectly offsets XXXXXX's role as XXXXX. I am a big fan of underwater films. This film was beautifully shot in the Bahamas like "Thunderball" (1965 UA) was. The director of photography was XXXX XXXXXX A.S.C. who lensed the film "Jaws" in 1975. XXX XXXXXX is a very talented cinematographer. The underwater director of photography was XXXX XXXXXX. He did a superb job with the underwater cinematography. I enjoyed the film score by XXXX XXXXXXX. This good film score featured Crosby, XXXXXX and Nash among other talented artists. This motion picture was shot in Panavision like "Thunderball" in the aspect ratio of 2.35:1 If possible try to see this film in a scope version as originally framed and visioned by XXXX XXXXXXX and XXXX XXXXXX. Another very nice thing is that XXX Shapiro gave the "original" XXXXX XXXXX (XXXX XXXXXX) a small part in this remake. He portrayed XXXXXX XXXXXXXXX #3 in this film. This was a very kind gesture on XXX Shapiro's part! As you can tell I am a real true fan of this film. Sadly this beautiful film was met with harsh words by the majority of movie critics. I originally saw this movie on my birthday, May 31st of 1996 in a movie theater. It meant a lot to me. I have it on numerous video versions. The VHS versions are in "pan and scan". The laserdisc version is "letterboxed" 2.35:1! I even have a VCD in 2.35:1 from Hong Kong which is "letterboxed". But my most prized possession is an "original" 16mm theatrical feature print which I will treasure for the rest of my life! Thank you XXX Shapiro, XXXXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXXX and everyone involved for making this a memorable movie for me to enjoy!<br /><br />P.S. I must add that the quality of the XXXXXXXXX DVD is superb! It is the best DVD as far as quality I have ever seen. The color and resolution is spectacular. The soundtrack is great. I think XXXXXXXXX must have used the same transfer for the DVD that they did for the laserdisc version. The 35mm scope print is "mint" and XXXX's film really has a wonderful look to it. A great tribute to a wonderful film! The DVD's resolution is even superior to the laserdisc quality! It's just spectacular! Thank you XXXXXXXXX Home Video for the great quality control and transfer. Many thank's for doing a superb job on this wonderful family film. Also many thank's to you XXXX for all your extreme kindness to me!!! It's a real honor to know you!!!
