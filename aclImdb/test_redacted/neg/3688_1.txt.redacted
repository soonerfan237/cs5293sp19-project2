This may not be the worst movie ever made, but it is absolutely the most boring. Wonder why it is shot mostly in the dark, and mostly with XXXXXXX Gallo walking away from the camera, or looking down? Because he doesn't want to show his face for actually agreeing to being in this movie. I liked his early stuff, but the pretentiousness of the "XXXXX Bunny" and then being cast in this drivel knocked him down a peg in my book. And XXX Kilmer? I actually want to send him a sympathy card. The "doors" to this??? Actually the casting was the only reason I watched this movie, and XXX doesn't even show up until the movie is more than halfway over. Simply a sad movie.
