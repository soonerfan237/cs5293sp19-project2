The film has no connection with the real life in Bosnia in those days. Should be more realistic and shows the viewer real traumas that were happening to common people during the war. Please see some films of Yugoslav authors (XXXX Kusturica, Ljubisa Samardzic,...e.g. Bure baruta( A barrel of powder), XXXX i ja (XXXX and me), Lepa sela lepo gore (Beautiful Villages burn Beautiful), etc... Just this is the real way to know about so called Bosnian problem. Hollywood is definitive not th right address to make films about the Balcan peninsula. Maybe XXXXXXX, WW II,... but not of the Slavs living in former Yugoslavia.
