I love this film. Tense with great characters. The kid from "XXXXXXX" is excellent as is Corey Feldman. When the kids storm the bank, it is pure adrenaline. Inside of the bank, it becomes a bit like a "Lord of the Flies" situation where they turn on each other. XXXXXX Walker from "Clueless" is wonderful. I saw this on "Showtime" while channel surfing. It was a pleasant surprise. XXXXX Remar is also quite good here as the small town Sheriff. XXXXXX Nichols who I love from "Barcelona" does a nice job too as a Federal Agent. I recommend this film for any fan of bank robbery movies with a lot of good characters. I was shocked to discover that XXXXX Corman was a producer on this, since the film is not a B movie.
