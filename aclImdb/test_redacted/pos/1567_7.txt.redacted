There's nothing much to the story. A young woman steals some money from the dreary Vermont supermarket where she works, decides to run away to Florida where he has dreams of attending school with her friend XXXXX, and encounters an odd couple on the highway. If you remember the elderly couple from "XXXXXXXX's XXXX," you have some idea of what these two are like. XXXX has a comical face and is retired from the Army. XXXXXX is an ex stripper now become a truckstop whore, although we don't find this out at once. They're affectionate, helpful, and full of common sense.<br /><br />They more or less adopt the girl, XXXXX, and promise to give her a ride in their elaborate RV, although they are not driving "directly" to Florida.<br /><br />This is where the film could have gone one-hundred-percent wrong. All the film makers had to do was turn the elderly couple into the personification of evil. They would take the virginal XXXXX (handcuffed to the bed or whatever) and sell her body to any greaseball driver who has a lot of money and likes rough sex. (XXXXX would have had a heck of a time escaping, with lots of aborted attempts, before the final shootout.) But, no. The couple really IS pretty nice, and XXXXX is far from virginal. XXXXX overhears XXXXXX with a customer, asks about the business, and tries to turn a trick on her own. XXXX prevents anything from happening and insists she do the job right if she's going to do it at all. They don't talk her into it. They guide her.<br /><br />XXXXX makes several hundred dollars, which is several hundred dollars more than she had when she met the couple. XXXX and XXXXXX keep her money in the safe where customers aren't going to find it. XXXXX misunderstands. She doesn't find whoring very pleasant work, and she thinks she'll never be paid off because every time she asks to be dropped off, XXXXXX responds with, "What? Not here, honey. Not in the middle of nowhere." However, after she is talked into handing her gun over to XXXXXX, the couple give her the money she wants and rather lovingly release her to continue her trip to Florida.<br /><br />You know what I found the most tragic moment in the film? It had nothing to do with prostitution or thievery. XXXXX has been expecting to room with her friend XXXXX after she arrives in Miami. XXXXX is after all a legitimate student. But when XXXXX calls her friend from someplace in Alabama to assure her she's on her way but will be late, XXXXX hesitates and says, "Well -- my mother doesn't think you should room with us. And to tell you the truth, my roommate isn't cool on it either. I invited you down, sure, but I thought it was just like a visit for a week or something. Go back to XXXXXXX, XXXXX" There is a long silence before XXXXX hangs up.<br /><br />Only one shot is fired (a few white frames of film) and no one is hit. Tears appear only once. Nobody slugs anybody else. No car explodes in a fireball. No cop chases them down the Interstate.<br /><br />The direction is occasionally clumsy. Too much cross-cutting between XXXXXX trying to disarm XXXXX and XXXXX's hand holding the wobbling pistol. There is hardly any musical score. There is brief male and female nudity and it's awkward, as it's probably supposed to be. XXXXX isn't unattractive but she is not babalicious either. She sports Asiatic eyes, a kind of robust version of XXXXX XXXXXX. The cinematography looks cheap and the colors are washed out. The direction is a straightforward narrative, with a few illuminating flashbacks. Nothing is wasted. And it was all evidently shot around XXXXXXX, Connecticut. The city sticks in my mind because I drove through it after one of its floods and remember the cars caked with a film of mud all the way up to the door handles.<br /><br />I don't know exactly What XXXXX Found. (I dread even THINKING that the answer to the riddle is that "she found herself.") The acting isn't bad at all. XXXXXX Ivey is better than that. It's definitely worth seeing, a quiet, orderly film that treats the audience like adults.
