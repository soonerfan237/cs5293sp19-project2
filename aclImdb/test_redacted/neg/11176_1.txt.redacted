I admit, I was taken in by the provocative stills of XXXXXXXXX Lewis from this film, as well as a comment on the IMDb message board devoted to her, calling this picture a "great underrated film". And so I got, with great difficulty, my own copy of "XXXX Help".<br /><br />What a waste.<br /><br />Nothing but a cheaply-made blood and gore movie with a ridiculous premise which I'm not even going to repeat, with several telegraphed sequences (for instance, when we see Lewis lovingly feeding her fish, we know right away what's going to happen to them later). Not even XXXXX, with her beautiful raven hair, large and luminous brown eyes, full and pouty lips, and stunning figure, can save this film. XXXXX fans would be better off with "Bare Essentials", "Sketch Artist", or even "Golden Child".
