Once again XXXXX is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot. Bugs of Daffy. He's unsure of what season it is and XXXXX and Duck arguing help matters not. Though XXXX proves he's the smartest once more by repeatedly using reverse psychology on Daffy in increasingly subtle ways. And when that runs out he does his trademark cross-dressing thingy. Daffy freaks out and demands the bunny be shot. Though XXXXX is too stupid he is hopelessly in love with the girl bunny thing. Elmer really is to blame for all this. If he weren't so dumb he'd know it REALLY is duck season and just blast XXXXX. But poor old Daff can't believe the utter preposterousness of the situation. His cruel plans of misdirection have been foiled by XXXXX's dumbness. Daffy is so shocked that he even goes home with XXXXX to be blasted in his living room.<br /><br />Poor Daff. He rules!
