I must admit that I am a fan of cheesy '80's cartoons, but this is among the best. XXXXXXX Brite and the Star Stealer is one of the most watchable and entertaining of the XXXXXXX Brite cartoons, and is much better than the TV series. I especially like the relationship between XXXXXXX and Darian and find it very amusing. My favorite character, though, is Starlite who is definitely the most "magnificent horse in the universe"!<br /><br />I also recommend XXXXXXX Brite: New Beginnings, which tells the story of how XXXXXXXland came to be. Have a Rainbow-Day!
