In the '60's/'70's, XXXXX XXXXX was renowned for his many supporting roles in television comedies such as 'Do Not Adjust Your Set!', 'Hark At Barker' and the 'Doctor' series. It was in 1974 that he landed his first leading role, in London Weekend Television's 'The Top Secret Life Of Edgar XXXXXX', written by XXXXXXX XXXXX & XXXXXXX McKenna.<br /><br />Edgar XXXXXX is a secret agent of the 'S.I.S' ('Secret Intelligence Service'). He genuinely tries to do his job well but always seems to mess things up. Astonishingly enough, though, he always succeeds in getting to the bottom of cases, much to the amazement of his colleagues- 'Buxton' (XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX), 'Spencer' (XXXX XXXX) and 'Cathy' (the lovely XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX), all of which answer to 'The Commander' (Noel Coleman).<br /><br />XXXXXX is married to 'Jennifer' (XXXXXXX XXXXXX), a woman who, much like XXXXXXX XXXXXXX's 'Betty' from 'Some XXXXXX's Do 'Ave 'Em!', has the patience of a saint and stands by her hare-brained (but well-meaning) husband, no matter what.<br /><br />Like 'Some XXXXXX's Do 'Ave 'Em' and 'The XXXXX XXX', 'T.T.S.L.O.E.B' was laced completely with slapstick. Each episode saw XXXXX perform stunts such as plummeting from a high window sill or falling from the top of a ladder while decorating his flat. It was 'custard pie in the face' stuff really.<br /><br />'Edgar XXXXXX' was not a big hit, due to poor scheduling from I.T.V. A shame as it was an amusing and enjoyable show, well served by its star and the fine support cast. The leading man, though, did not seem to enjoy the experience of the show. XXXXX XXXXX vetoed repeat screenings of the show because he felt his acting in it was non-refined. Granted, the XXXXX XXXXX who played 'Del Boy', 'Inspector XXXXX' and 'Pop XXXXXX' is way different to the one that played XXXXXX but by no means was his acting unrefined. Most actors would have turned XXXXXX into a ridiculous caricature but XXXXX's performance made XXXXXX a credible, realistic figure. XXX perhaps, but not unimaginable.<br /><br />XXXXX's next vehicle was 'Lucky XXXXXX', in which he played mummy's boy 'Shorty Mempstead'. It too failed to make the ratings. His lucky break came in the shape of A.T.V's 'A Sharp Intake Of XXXXXX', in which he played walking disaster area 'Peter XXXXXX' for four series between 1977-1981. So, while not outstanding as such, 'XXXXXX' is an easy and worthwhile watch. Nice 'James XXXX' style theme tune, too!
