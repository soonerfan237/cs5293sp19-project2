Very good political thriller regarding the aftermath of terrorism and the using of political torture to obtain one's objectives in flushing out the terrorists.<br /><br />The story is interwoven where two families are adversely affected by the terrorist events.<br /><br />This is one of XXXXX Streep's best roles in years. She plays a cold, calculating, cunning director of the CIA who allows these things to go on. She is out of the XXXXXX Bush-Dick Cheney school of handling the war on terrorism. Had her part been expanded, XXXX Streep certainly would have been up for an award at Oscar time.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal is our hero. A CIA agent who really can't take what's going on.<br /><br />We have a terrorist who actually has a heart and it costs him his life in this well directed, finely paced film.<br /><br />XXXX Arkin appears briefly in the part of a conniving senator. XXX Arkin seems to get better with age.
