This cosy middle class sitcom became the subject of much hatred by the new breed of talented comedians in the 1980s, such as XXX Elton. Did it deserve such malice? XXXX Terry and June was never clever, it was never a well-written tale with different threads which intersect at the conclusion. It was the show your mother and father and probably grandparents watched. They chuckled rather than laughed, but they were never likely to be offended by the show, so the fact that it never challenged them was immaterial.<br /><br />One Foot In The Grave suffered initially because it appeared at first sight to be just another XXXXX and June.<br /><br />A few days after the death of XXXXX Scott an episode was broadcast on terrestrial TV, and that has been its final outing. There have been few repeats of the show on any TV channel.<br /><br />Thankfully TV comedy has advanced since XXXXX and June. It's hard to find kind words for it - XXXXX Scott did make the best of weak scripts.
