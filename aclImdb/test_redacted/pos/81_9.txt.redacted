A savage, undisciplined lion has been put behind bars for a circus carnival. He suddenly notices a hole on the floor of his cell, then sticks his nose into this hole to snuff it. At first he thinks XXXX Bunny's home is belong to a camel; yet when he wakes XXXX up from his sleep hoisting him up to the ground, there he meets with XXXX, his next trainer. <br /><br />If you ever wonder how XXXX would turn a savage lion into a Hawaiian hula dancer with traditional skirts on, you should watch this cartoon. Director XXX McKimson offers endless laughters by means of absurd and unexpected demonstrative humour. <br /><br />The signature scenes include:<br /><br />1/ the look of XXXX Bunny's home, cross-referencing to Donald Duck with the B.B. name acronym on the headboard of Bugs's bed <br /><br />2/ Bugs XXXXX's short journey with the mine hoist climbing up to the ground floor <br /><br />3/ When Nero the Lion calls his friend the Elephant for help, Bugs uses a toy mouse to scare the Elephant; since the Elephant needed a broom to outpower that toy mouse, he uses Nero as a broom! <br /><br />4/ Bugs becoming a clown with the proper costume and make-up and the practical clown jokes that he makes <br /><br />5/ the trapeze scene while XXXX chasing after Bugs <br /><br />6/ the famous Human Cannonball scene after which XXXX the Lion starts dancing Hawaiian Hula<br /><br />The magic moments which keep Acrobatty Bunny fresh at all times in our memory:<br /><br />1/ When Bugs comes out of his bunny hole, he thinks he's in the Pinocchio tale; and starts acting to save Pinocchio out of the giant whale's stomach <br /><br />2/ When the Lion roars to scare him, Bugs replies back to him with roaring<br /><br />3/ Bugs arguing with the Lion for he's making so much noise, then finding a piece of wood to rub it against the iron bars while singing in order to make more noise than him <br /><br />4/ Wearing rubber heels at the circus, Bugs starts to bounce like toy rabbits and causes XXXX to bounce! <br /><br />Those are the 10 main reasons that keeps Acrobatty XXXXX as a Bugs XXXXX classic and can be found in the "Bugs XXXXX Classics' MGM/UA Video (1989)"
