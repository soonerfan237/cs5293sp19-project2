I saw the film at the Brooklyn International Film Festival (World Premiere).<br /><br />A haunting, intimate portrait of Loneliness, and the repercussions of letting it grow and turn into something darker.<br /><br />The acting of the two leads (Jessica Bohl & XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX) is excellent, and makes one wish you had met these characters before they became so damaged.<br /><br />Reminded me in theme of the works of XXXX XXXXXX (Exotica) and XXXXXXX XXXXXX (Where I'm Calling From).<br /><br />The Soundtrack (XXXXXXX XX XXXXXXXX, XXXXXXX XXXXXXX) is excellent and reinforces moments in the film without drawing attention to itself.<br /><br />Highly recommend the Film and the Soundtrack.
