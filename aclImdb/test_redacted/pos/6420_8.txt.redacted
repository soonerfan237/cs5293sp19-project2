In a bizarre experiment, an astronaut is abandoned on the moon as XXXXX (XXXXXXXX XXXXXX), a troubled translator living in Italy, wakes from a nightmare about a lunar mission mixed with an old movie that frightened her as a child. She also has no recollection of the last three days except for a torn photo of the Garma hotel she finds in her apartment. Fired from her job, XXXXX heads to that resort island to try and piece together the mystery...<br /><br />XXXXX touted as a giallo due to it's director (THE FIFTH CORD's XXXXX XXXXXXX) and the presence of Evelyn XXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXX XXXX, and XXXXX XXXXXX, FOOTPRINTS is actually a deliberately paced psycho-thriller with sci-fi overtones. Blurring the distinction between dream, reality, memory and movies, the disturbing story is beautifully photographed by Oscar-winner Vittorio Storaro with a pensive score by XXXXXX XXXXXXX. It also combines elements of such diverse films as XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX's MACCHE SOLARI and XXXXXX XXXXXXXX's DEATH IN VENICE in it's depiction of alienation, isolation, hallucination, and maybe madness. Brazilian actress XXXXXXXX XXXXXX, on screen all the time, does a redux of her XXXXX XXXXXXX in Lucio Fulci's A LIZARD IN A WOMAN'S SKIN as XXXXX, a young woman thrust into a mystery that makes her question her sanity. The locations mirror XXXXX's unstable state of mind; the island of Garma, off-season, with it's XXXXXX influence and ancient ruins, is a lonely, almost mystical place unwilling to give up its secrets. Evelyn XXXXXXX has a bit in the beginning as a concerned friend, XXXXXXXXX XXXX and Oscar-winner Lila Kedrova are hotel guests, XXXXX XXXXXXX plays a handsome biologist trying to help XXXXXX, and the ever-intense XXXXX XXXXXX is "Blackmann" in the film-within-a-film, "Footprints On The Moon". <br /><br />FOOTPRINTS is a classy case of "Guaranteed 100% Euro-weird" but not for everyone. There's only one murder toward the end but you won't see it coming as the film starts to come together.
