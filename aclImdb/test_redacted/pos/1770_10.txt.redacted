The cast for this production of Rigoletto is excellent. XXXXX Gruberova sings Gilda magnificently and passionately. XXXXXXX Pavarotti also sings splendidly. Vergara is a fine Maddalena; XXXXXX Barbieri is a famous older singer who sings the maid, Giovanna. Weikl sings XXXXXXX; Wixell sings both Rigoletto and Monterone. As XXXXXXXXX, Wixell is probably the most convincing acting singer in this hard-to-beat ensemble of great singers. XXXXXXXX Kuhlmann in the Contessa. All principals are well-known and world-renowned.<br /><br />This is an exciting Rigoletto visually as well as musically.<br /><br />I have it on both laser disc and DVD. You should have it too!
