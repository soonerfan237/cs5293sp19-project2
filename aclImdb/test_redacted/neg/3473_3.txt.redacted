"Nero" as the title of the movie is in Germany is a another attempt to show one of the most interesting Roman emperors, XXXXXX Domitius Ahenobarbus, better known as Nero. Although this attempt at least tried to show a more historic accurate XXXX than the amusing but completely fictitious XXXX Peter Ustinov played in "Quo Vadis!" it still is a major failure. And to those IMDb-commentators who still believe that XXXXXX and Tacitus propaganda is true, please read a book about Nero that was published less than 20 years ago. XXXX did NOT burn Rome, this is proved! He did not murder Britannicus. He did not torture, kill and maim for pleasure, he was the first emperor who BANNED the gladiator fights. The movie still shows a lot of mistakes, errors and is by the way made in a really cheap style, especially the sets were cheap and unconvincing, the palace looking like some villa, the city itself looked like..well like a cheap set. The acting was between good and sub-par, the music nearly insignificant and the movie soon deteriorated after XXXX became emperor to a rushed, bad edited mess without any clear narrative structure. So there still is the potential for an epic biography of Nero that shows the true Nero, who was one of the best emperors who ruled Rome, despite the lies of Sueton et al.
