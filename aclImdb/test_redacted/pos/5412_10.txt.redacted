Wow. When I went to this film at the Toronto film festival I had no idea what I was in for. This movie takes you on an emotional roller-coaster in the best sense of the term. XXXXXXXXX XXXXXX was better than I've seen from her in years; XXXXX XXXXXX was great and XXXX XXXXXXX broke my heart. I can see how this won't be every person's cup of tea, as at times it deals with some pretty harsh things that can happen to a family. Don't get me wrong -- it's really funny too -- at my screening the audience burst out in applause after laughing over and over again. I just think if you're open to examining your own life, XXXXXXXXX XXXXXX will sincerely touch you. I can't wait until it comes out in theaters.
