I never heard of architect, XXXXX Kahn, until this documentary. In this almost two hour documentary which goes very quickly, his son, XXXXXXXXX Kahn, explores his father's life from Estonia to the slums of North Philadelphia to the University of Pennsylvania in West Philadelphia where he studied and taught. He travels to Bangladesh, Israel, Connecticut, XXXXXXX, and La Jolla, California as well as New York City to explore his father's creative genius. Personally, XXXXX Kahn had three families including his wife, Esther, who refused to give him a divorce and their daughter Sue Ann. XXXXXXXXX includes his family members. XXXXX also has another half-sister Alexandra Tynge from his father's previous relationship with Anne Tyne, a fellow architect. XXXXX' passion was his art.
