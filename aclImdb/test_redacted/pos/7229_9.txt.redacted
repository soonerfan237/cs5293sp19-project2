In the seedy streets somewhere in New York City, a lonely punk named XXXXXX ( XXXX XXXXXX) has little friends but all they ever do is get tattoos, piercing and just party all the time. He does fall for a beautiful rich girl named XXXXXX ( XXXX XXXXXX) whom is also troubled as her father is being quite an abusive son of a you know what, but as our title characters meet and fall for each other things start becoming quite magical for them. Unfortunately their fathers are at each other as XXXXXX's dad wants to take over XXXXXX's dad's movie studio, but could love really conquer them all and stop this feud? <br /><br />Hilarious and gross horror comedy drama satire from the wacky and disgusting people at XXXXX is a wonderful modern day take on XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX's XXXXX and XXXXXX. This was released in theaters in 1997 and got some good reviews for this is a dark humored satire of the legendary story that started it all, it's got some good laughs, piercing, graphic violence and gore such as a head being smashed on a fire hydrant. For me this is the third best XXXXX movie next to the immortal "XXXXX XXXXXXX" and "XXXXX's War" being second, yes the acting can be a little bad like some XXXXX flicks but the stuff above makes it up for that and this is a must see movie if you like horror comedies, XXXXX XXXXXXX, and XXXXX or if you wanna see a comical version of a beloved story, BTW also look for a couple of amusing appearances by The XXXXX XXXXXXX and SGT.
