The new voices scare me! XXXXX doesn't have to pass some frickkin' academy to become emperor again! It's the same thing over and over, isn't it? This IS a kids' show, right? XXXX turns XXXXX into something stupid, like an animal. He learns a lesson. EVERYTHING IS THE SAME!!!!! XXXXX Spade and XXXX XXXXXXX never returned... *sniffle*! Nothing changes 'cause Disney won't do anything 'bout it. It's probably one of the most retarded shows ever! The first movie was so damn better! Malina's probably the only person I like. XXXXX's such a crybaby! Kronk is retarded! And XXXX's retarded-ER (if that's even a word)! What I meant to say is... How could you, Disney... why?
