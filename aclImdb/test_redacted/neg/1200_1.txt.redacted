<br /><br />I still can't belive XXXXX Gossett Jr. agreed to appear in this film. Everything about this move feels artificial, forced, and contrived. The air sequences are flat. The enemy characters seem like puppets. This is just a poor excuse of a movie. At least Top XXX had air sequences that looked good (the external shots anyway). The songs by XXXXX are cool, though. XXXX Midway instead.
