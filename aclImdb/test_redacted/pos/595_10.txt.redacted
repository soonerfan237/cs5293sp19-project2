I have always loved The XXXXXXs. Though most children's entertainment then wasn't that likable, The XXXXXX's was. The XXXXXX's are very, very funny. They are probably the most likable children's characters ever. <br /><br />Not only did The XXXXXXs have their own show. They also have starred in many films. from The XXXXXX's Christmas carol to The XXXXXX's treasure Island. The first XXXXXX's movie, The XXXXXX movie, was also, like the show and the other films, excellent.<br /><br />The XXXXXX movie is about how they all got started. XXXXXX the frog used to live in a swamp. Until one day a movie executive tells him that there are auditions for frogs in XXXXXXXXX. So XXXXXX takes off for XXXXXXXXX. Along the way he runs into lots of people such as XXXXXX XXXX, Gonzo the great, and XXXX XXXXX. Also, an evil man is trying to capture XXXXXX.<br /><br />All of the XXXXXX films are highly enjoyable. I mean they are all very funny. This film has many film appearances. Such as XXXXX XXXXXX, XXX XXXXXX, XXXXXX XXXXX, XXXXX XXXX, XXXXXXX XXXXX, and XXXXX XXXXXX. The XXXXXX films are all very enjoyable. I hear that XXXXX XXXXX is going to star in one soon. I can't wait to see it.
