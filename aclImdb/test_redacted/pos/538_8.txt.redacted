XXXXX Sarandon. She made this movie for me. I've never appreciated her acting more than as I did in this movie. She really acted as though she were XXXXX August. I can appreciate actors and actresses who leave their individual persona and create a character who's truly believable. <br /><br />XXXXXXX Portman as Ann August helped create the ideal antagonist as their characters developed through the movie. The movie was about them so the other characters were peripheral.<br /><br />I gave this movie an eight rating, but XXXXX received a ten from me because of her performance. As far as relationship movies go, XXXXXXX and Terms of Endearment had a greater impact on me than this movie, but I highly recommend it.
