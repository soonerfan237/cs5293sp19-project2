This is a decent effort for a B-Movie XXXXXXX XXXX actioner. XXX XXXXXXX, a former North American cruiser weight Kickboxing champion, is the lead and acquits himself well in the action scenes. The muscular XXXXXXXX XXXX gets a chance to add more to his XXXXXXX XXXX bad guy persona in this film than in all of his many others and if you are a fan of The Teutonic Titan, rent this movie now!<br /><br />XXXXX XXXXXXX is also noteworthy as the romantic interest in this film. She starts off with attitude but soon warms up to the hero and they make "The beast with two backs" in a very stylish fashion.<br /><br />The fight scenes are good in the American tradition (NO Hong Kong acrobatics here!) with added realism from having XXXXX "The Jet" Urquidez playing himself as XXXX XXXXXX's (XXXXXXX) trainer.<br /><br />All in all this film seems to have more sub plots than most in its genre so you get MORE of a story.
