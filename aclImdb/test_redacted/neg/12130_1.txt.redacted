This movie was pure genius. XXXX Waters is brilliant. It is hilarious and I am not sick of it even after seeing it about 20 times since I bought it a few months ago. The acting is great, although XXXXX Lake could have been better. And XXXXXX Depp is magnificent. He is such a beautiful man and a very talented actor. And seeing most of XXXXXX's movies, this is probably my favorite. I give it 9.5/10. Rent it today!
