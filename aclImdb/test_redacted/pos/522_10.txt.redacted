I like seeing XXXXX Blair playing in an actual "horror" movie again. I had been disappointed with her in most everything since the "Exorcist "movies (XXXXX i loved). What was up with all of those nasty "B-movies" she did? <br /><br />XXXXX Hassellhoff on the other hand, all i could do is laugh. He is not cut out to be a horror movie actor. XXXXX needs to stick to "Knight Rider" or "Baywatch".<br /><br />All around, this is an awesome movie. Even for the eighties, this was an awesome film. It has horror, action, and drama. It is a suspenseful, and I loved the way XXXXX Blair turned out.
