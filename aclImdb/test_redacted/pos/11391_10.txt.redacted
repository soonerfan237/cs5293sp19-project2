XXXXXX Nights was without a doubt the best film of 1997. I could watch this movie over and over and over and still love it. I'm in no rush to watch that overblown romance/disaster epic XXXXXXX again. The fact that Boogie Nights did not even receive a Best Picture nomination just goes to prove how predictable and narrow-minded the Academy is. Only XXXX Egoyan's The Sweet Hereafter and Robert Zemeckis's Contact came close to being as great as Boogie Nights. No other filmmaker in recent years has come even remotely close to making a film as good as XXXXXXXXX's Pulp Fiction -- until now. XXXX Thomas Anderson rose to the challenge and succeeded. Just as XXXXXXXXX gave John Travolta's career a kick, P.T. XXXXXXXX has given Burt Reynolds the kick that his career needs. XXXXXX Nights will also undoubtedly make stars of Don Cheadle, Heather Graham, and John Reilly. Overall, a wonderful film. The best since XXXX Fiction. Maybe even better.
