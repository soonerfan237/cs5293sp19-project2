Between the ages of 30 and 51, when he died of a brain tumour, XXXXXXX XXXXX made 70 films. He was introduced in 1944 in Jean Negulesco's 'The Mask of XXXXXXXXX', where he played XXXXXXXXX. The next year, 1945, he made three films, of which this is one. He is best remembered by cineastes as the star of XXXX XXXXXX's 'The XXXXXXXXXX', one of the 1945 films, where he had a sympathetic role. However, he often played creepy characters, and in this film he is a sociopathic killer of women for money. So what happens here? He lives in a house with three women, so watch out! XXXX XXXXXXX, who also appeared in 'XXXXXXXXX', plays the older of two daughters in the house. She falls in love with XXXXX and they become secretly engaged. Then her 'cute kid' younger sister (played effectively by XXXX XXXXXXX, who resembles XXXXXX XXXXXXXXX both in looks and in behaviour) returns from boarding school and reveals casually in conversation with XXXXX that she has inherited a tidy sum, so XXXXX turns his sights on her instead, with all the torrid jealousies seething in the household which that was bound to arouse. Things get tense, and then they get tenser. Meanwhile, plans for murder are going forward in the mind of the calculating XXXXX. But it turns out that he is not the only one with such intentions. He is also being searched for as a result of his last kill, with which the film has opened, so that we know his back story. XXXXX Wong Howe gives effective noirish cinematography to this tale, which was directed by XXXXXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXX who had moved to Hollywood some time earlier. The film is an effective psychopath-in-the-house mystery which can cause a bit of wear of the edges of some seats, for those of such an inclination.
