After seeing Forever XXXXXXXXX, it would be natural to want to see a John Waters film. At least, one get to say that they have joined the legions of cinema cognoscenti who have experienced the unique cinematic stylings of perhaps the best known non-mainstream director. It's worth the effort, and PF is a lot better than XXXXXXXXXX,and there is a certain campiness about his films which his followers find addicting.
