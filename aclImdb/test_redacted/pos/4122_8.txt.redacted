Even after nearly 20 years apart, the original members of XXXXX XXXXXXX have not lost a thing. In this concert, they perform their best songs from their heyday (1970-1978), including "N.I.B.", "War Pigs", and "Paranoid".<br /><br />Also included is priceless backstage footage with interviews and retrospectives into their days as the top hard rock band on the planet. The comments of Ozzy, XXXX XXXXX, XXXXXX XXXXXX, and XXXX XXXX are just as interesting and intriguing to watch as the fabulous onstage performances.<br /><br />A must-see for all Sabbath and Ozzy fans.
