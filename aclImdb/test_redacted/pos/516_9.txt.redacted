I didn't see this movie until it appeared on television because I was doubtful about comic flicks. Ever since the "Batman" series, "Spawn," "Judge XXXXX," and many other pitiful p.g.-13 bombs, I dodged everything at all cost. I would question in my mind, "why can't someone make a movie that is rated R and stays true to the story, how difficult is that?" And finally my prayers have been answered with XXXXX. This movie pops right out of the pages onto the screen with sheer violence, blood, martial arts, weapons, fire, the good against evil, etc. Yeah sure a lot of action flicks contain all these goodies, and most of them have bombed. But not XXXXX, the movie was filmed just right, not going overboard, delivering a good length and never a dull moment. XXXXX II is cool, but not as cool as the first. Blade is indeed one of the best real comic flicks I've seen in a long time.
