This is quite an entertaining B-flick in the Universal Horror series featuring XXXXXXX, the Wolfman, and Frankenstein's Monster. The plot revolves around Dracula (XXXX Carradine) and Larry Talbot, the wolfman (Lon Chaney Jr.), separately visiting a revolutionary doctor. They both ask him if they can be cured, and the doctor attempts to devise a way for each. Beneath the doctor's castle, they find XXXXXXXXXXXX's Monster buried in mud (this is apparently a reference to the previous movie in the XXXXXXXXXXXX series). <br /><br />Of course, if things had went as planned, the movie would have turned out incredibly boring. Instead, XXXXXXX can't suppress his appetite, and the doctor is eventually infected, by a blood transfusion, with vampirism. As a semi-vampire, the doctor goes insane and awakens XXXXXXXXXXXX's Monster. As with all of the Universal Horror series, the ending is completely unsatisfactory. A beautiful woman with a hunchback, one of the doctor's two assistants, has a particularly gruesome end. Plus, you just have to feel sorry for XXXXXXXXXXXX's Monster in this film - he's awake for around two minutes, kills one police officer, and then yet another building (what's this, the fifth now?) collapses on top of him and is consumed by flames. It is also unfortunate that the great character created in The Wolf Man (1941), XXXXX Talbot, is really reduced here. People underrate that film and XXXXXX's performance in it. Here, he would be justifiably criticized as wooden. All in all, though, it's a pretty fun movie at just 68 minutes. A nice waste of time. 7/10.
