This is far the most worst film I've seen this year from XXXXXXXXX so far. I may not lie, my wife liked this film very much. It was not XXXXX Deol or Arjun Rampal what made this film become unbelievable, but it was Amisha Patel. She performs the role of a blind woman who get in trouble when she almost fall from a mountain where (luckily for her) the hero XXXXX Rampal comes to rescue her (in the middle of nowhere). It amazes me here how a blind girl is aware of danger when she is about to fall from a mountain, because she cannot see her environment. From this scene I started to watch the movie very closely and in every scene there was a flaw in the acting of XXXXXX Patel. The way she plays a blind girl is very bad. The only way she does that is by not to look into the eyes of the person she talks with. When I saw this film, I respected XXXX Mukherjee more with her performance in the movie Black. XXXXXX will never reach this level in performing as an actress.<br /><br />Anyway, she falls in love with Arjun Rampal. It is the clich√© story. XXXXXX Arjun gets killed by a man who is madly in love with Amisha. Amisha is in despair, but then XXXXX enters the movie. He also falls in love with the blind girl. XXXXX Deol is a great actor in my point of view, but he cannot pull the film to a higher level where Amisha Patel buries it deep into the ground. I must say XXXXX deserves better roles in better movies than he got so far. XXXXX grew in acting from the first movie his lovely daddy gave him. He was so bad in acting in Barsaat, but when you see him acting now, you get the shivers and believe every word he says. Only a movie with high potential like a Yash Copra film has to meet his way.<br /><br />Okay, when XXXXXX also falls in love with Bobby, someones enters her life. XXXXX Rampal is not dead! Who believes this crap? I don't. Why didn't they give his role to one of the ugly guys from the movie family (Shushant Singh or XXXXXXX Ramsay) and give Bobby a role in one of the blockbusters with Amitabh Bachchan? I'm sorry if my comment sounds like a cry for an actor like XXXXX to give him a great role, but he deserves so much better than a movie with Amisha (bigscreen t.v. face) XXXXX. This movie was so awful, that I regret buying it.
