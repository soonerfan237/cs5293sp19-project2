I am surprised people, after such lousy movies getting to be in the top 250 or just being in the 7.0's, I thought more people would get a kick out of "XXXXX Momma from the Train". This was a great comedy by two terrific comedic actors, XXXXX Crystal and Danny DeVito. Together they made a great duo of insanity and obsession. XXXXX is a man who just lost his million dollar story to his ex wife and repeatedly wishes her dead, Danny has an insane and senile old mother who just abuses him. When XXXXX gives some "misunderstood" advice to Danny, Danny offers a proposition to XXXXX, if he kills his ex wife, XXXXX has to kill his mother. This is a crazy and funny story that can always get a good laugh. Please, sit back and enjoy this movie, people! It's a good one!<br /><br />7/10
