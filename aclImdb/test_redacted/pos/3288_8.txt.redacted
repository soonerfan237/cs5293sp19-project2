Eager electronics whiz XXXXX XXXXXX (a likable performance by XXXXXX XXXX of TV's "Land of the Lost") creates a computerized watchdog called C.H.O.M.P.S. (an acronym for XXXXXX XXXX Protection System) for his boss XXX XXXXX XXXXXX (nicely played by Conrad Baain), whose home security business is floundering. A rival company hires a pair of inept criminals to get their grubby hands on C.H.O.M.P.S.; said task proves to be easier said than done. XXXXXXXX XXX XXXXXXX relates the endearingly dopey story at a constant brisk pace, maintains an amiably silly and lighthearted tone throughout, and stages the goofy slapstick gags with considerable flair. Moreover, the game cast mug it up with infectious aplomb: the adorable XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX as Brian's sweet fianc√© XXXXX XXXXXX, XXXXX XXXXXX as klutzy crook XXXXXX, XXX XXXXXXX as McCann's equally bumbling partner XXXXXXX, XXX XXXXXX as evil CEO XXX XXXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX as nice old biddy Ms. Foster, and 60's AIP exploitation feature regular XXXXX XXXXXX as smarmy, duplicitous suit XXX XXXXX. Best of all, the titular pooch is a cuddly delight: C.H.O.M.P.S. jumps through fences, walls and windows with amazing agility, performs acts of exceptional strength, runs faster than a deer, and even does a few nifty martial arts moves. A subplot about a hulking neighborhood hound named XXXXXXX supplies a few extra belly laughs (XXXXXXX is voiced by some uncredited guy with an appropriately deep, growly voice). The groovy animated opening credits sequence, XXXXXXX XX XXXXXXX's glossy cinematography, and XXXX XXXXXX's funky, pulsating disco score are all solid as well. A cute little kiddie flick.
