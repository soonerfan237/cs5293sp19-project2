XXXXXX Stone, always ready to make politically-themed movies, makes another one here. "Talk Radio" is loosely based on the career of XXXX Berg, a radio talk show host in Denver who was murdered by white supremacists. In this case, the character is XXXXX Champlain (Eric Bogosian), an outspoken talk show host in Dallas who loves nothing more than to irk the people who call in. As it is, most of the people who call in are a bunch of pigheaded racists. And things may be heating up more than anyone realizes.<br /><br />XXXXXXXX's performance brings a light comical tone to an otherwise serious movie. I really liked the scene where he jabs at a redneck who calls in. Granted, I wouldn't call this Oliver Stone's greatest movie ever, but it's a good reference in an era when media gets more and more concentrated. Good performances by XXXXX Greene and Alec Baldwin also help.
