Drivel. Utter junk. The writers must not have read the book, or seen XXXXX Lynch's film. Not worth wasting your time.<br /><br />Longer does not make better. While more in-depth then XXXXX's film, it has gross in-accuracies, and down-play's key parts of the story.<br /><br />"A Night at the Roxbury" is more worth your time.
