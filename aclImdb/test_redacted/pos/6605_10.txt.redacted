XXXXXXX and Z-Boys<br /><br />Summary: XXXXXXX and Z-boys is a documentary about a group of revolutionary teenagers that changed the world of surfing and skateboarding in Venice (XXXXXXX), California as we know it today. With their low pivotal style, they embarked on a XXXXX XXXXXXXXX influenced journey that would lead to countless successes and a couple failures. After the XXXXXXX articles were featured in a reinstated Skateboarder Magazine, the sport was revamped and the members of the Zephyr skateboard team forgot about XXXX XX, and looked to be on summer vacation for the rest of their lives by joining other skateboard teams that could afford to pay them like movie stars. The original XXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX XXXX put together by XXXX XX (Zephyr Surfshop Owner) and XXXXX XXXXXX (Photographer) included XXX XXXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXXX XXXXXXX, XXX XXXXXX, XXXXX XXXXXX, XXXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXX, XXX XXXX, XXXXX XXX (the only female), XXXXXX XXXXX, XXXXXXX XXXX XX, XXXXX XXXXX, and XXXXX XXX XXXXX. All of the original members except XXX XXXXX and XXXXX XXXXXX are still well and surfing/skating. XXX XXXXX, at the time of the documentary, was serving time on drug related charges. XXXXX XXXXXX, at the time of the documentary, was last seen in Mexico.<br /><br />Themes: The themes of this documentary are kind of read-between-the-lines, but if there were a clear-cut theme it would be that even kids can spark revolutions. Other themes would include extensive partying in one's past may lead to an unfulfilling future, and by planning and being careful with one's assets a very rewarding future could be at hand.<br /><br />Other Works: XXXXX XXXXXXX (Writer and Director) has a fairly wide range of documentaries that he has either written, produced, or directed. Most with a common theme of surfing or skateboarding, such as Riding XXXXXX, XXX TV, The Bones Brigrades, and Lords of XXXXXXX. He has also done films with a theme of growing up in America as a teenager, films such as: Influences: From Yesterday to Today, XXXXX and XXXXXX: Made in America, and The 70s: The Decade that Changed Television.<br /><br />Subjects: The subjects of XXXXXXX and Z-boys are the original members of the XXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX XXXX excluding XXXXX XXXXXX. XXXXXXX included XXXX XX and XXXXX XXXXXX in the interviews. Other subjects were people who grew up during the 70s reading the XXXXXXX Articles as well as skateboard enthusiasts. Skaters from the XXXXXXX area, but not on the team were interviewed.<br /><br />Editing: The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion. There were scenes of the subjects talking so that the audience could see who was speaking and get a sense of the character, but would immediately cutaway to archival footage that would explain what the speaker was saying. When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when XXX XXXXX' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song Old Man by XXXX XXXXX was played, which evokes many emotions. Sean XXXX was the narrator for the film and he explained the transitions throughout the film. The film was presented chronologically from the time the Zephyr surf team was put together, to creating the skateboard team, to all of the Z-boys leaving the team to join other skate companies or create their own company. <br /><br />Cinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way. The film of the subjects speaking were all in black and white and all of the archival footage of the Z-Boys surfing or skating were in color. Of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film. The interviewees were mostly shot in the same area it appears, but all were outside. All of the footage was very well-controlled even the archival footage which I found very surprising. <br /><br />Music: "Seasons of Wither"-Performed by XXXXXXXXX "Toys in the Attic"-Performed by XXXXXXXXX "Generation Landslide"- XXXXX XXXXXX "One Way Out"- Performed by The Allman Brothers "Lollipops and XXXXX" and "Whipped XXXXX"-performed by XXXX XXXXXX "Into the Void" and "Paranoid"- performed by XXXXX XXXXXXX "Godzilla"- XXXX XXXXXX XXXX "XXXXXXX XXXX" and "XXXXX XXXXX"- XXXXX XXXXX "Fastcars"- The Buzzcocks "XXX XXXXXXX"- Devo "I'll Give you Money"- XXXXX XXXXXXXX "Funk 49"- XXXXX XXXX "XXX XXXXX" and "XXXX XXXX" and "XXXXXXX" and "Bold as XXXX"- XXXX XXXXXXX "XXXXXXXX XXXXXXX"- XXX and Dean "Achilles Last Stand" and "Hot on for Nowhere"- XXX XXXXXXXX "Six Underground"- The Sneaker Pimps "Surfrider"- The Lively Ones "XXX XXXXXXX XXXXX" and "XXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX" and "XXXX XXXX XXXXX Poontang- Ted Nugent "Us and Them"- XXXX XXXXX "XXX XXXX"- The Pretenders "XXXXXX XXX"- XXX XXXXXXX "I Wanna be Your Dog" and "Gimme XXXXXX"- The Stooges "Children of the Revolution"- T-Rex "XXX XXXXXXXXXX"- XXXX XXXXX "XXXXX XXXXXXX"- The Tramps "Hannah"- XXX XXXXXX "XXXXX XXXXXXXX XXX"- XXX XXXXX "Old Man"- XXXX XXXXX "La Grange"- ZZ Top<br /><br />The music in the film make the movie.
