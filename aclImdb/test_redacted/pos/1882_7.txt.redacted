I haven't seen so many people packed outside a theater since XXXX XXXX XXXXXXX XXX. Both shows sold out, and for good reason. The Man With the Screaming XXXXX was the best movie to see with a crowd full of geeks. (Hey, I'm a dork too.) <br /><br />XXXXX XXXXXXXX was present and had the whole crowd in stitches! The movie was cheesy in the best possible way. It may be the funniest movie that XXXXX has done. XXX XXXXX steals the show with his Bulgarian hip hop-itude and zany facial expressions, he is a laugh riot! Who knew that XXX could rap? <br /><br />I changed my mind, the person who stole the show was actually a robot. There is nothing funnier than a robot...doing the robot.<br /><br />As for XXXXX's performance: "I take the 5th." Thanks XXXXX. Thanks for being cool, thanks for taking the time, thanks for all of the fun.
