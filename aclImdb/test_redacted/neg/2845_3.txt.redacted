Low-rent version of XXXXXX Judd's Double Jeopardy. Sutherland is too professional to be bad, but what was XXXXXX Fonda thinking?!? The Penelope Ann Miller curse continues (Think about it--when has she EVER been in a good movie other than Other People's XXXXX? And I'm not saying she's bad, but all of her movies fail in some way).
