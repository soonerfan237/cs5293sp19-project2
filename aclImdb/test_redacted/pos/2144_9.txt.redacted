Until today, I thought there only three people, including me, who considered XXXXXX's Gate (1980)to be a masterpiece and perhaps the last great western, (since the 1970), after, XXXXXX XXX XXX (1970), XXXXXXXX XXXXXXX (1972), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) and The Long Riders (1980).<br /><br /> I was stunned and pleased to see that 22.5% of those voting at IMDB rate this movie a 10, as do I. A recent book, the Worst Movies of All Time, includes XXXXXX's Gate. Through it's production and release it was vilified, as no movie since XXXXXXXXX, almost twenty years before. At one time it was considered the most expensive over-budget movie of all time, surpassing even XXXXXXXXX. It was blamed for the downfall of its studio, United Artists, until everyone finally saw all the studios were falling. XXXXXXX XXXXXX, fresh from his glory with the Deer Hunter was hated and despised for his success and movie making excess, but clearly, that was petty jealousy at its worst.<br /><br /> XXXXXX ended up fashioning one of the great expositions of the American experience. This film is not to be missed but any serious student of American filmmaking.
