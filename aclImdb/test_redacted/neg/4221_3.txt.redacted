As everyone knows, nobody can play XXXXXXXX O'Hara like Vivien Leigh, and nobody can play Rhett Butler like Clark Gable. All others pale in comparison, and XXXXXXX Dalton and Joanne Whalley are no exceptions. One thing that I really couldn't get past was that XXXXXX has BROWN eyes. The green eyes were the most enhancing feature of XXXXXXXX's good looks, and in this sequel she has been stripped of those.<br /><br />The movie, as well as the book, had several lulls in it. The new characters weren't all that memorable, and I found myself forgetting who was who. I felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever. It could be that I'm only 11, but I saw no change in her attitude until the last say, 10 minutes when XXXXX told her she had grown up. If XXXXX hadn't told her that, I would have never guessed that there was any change in her attitude. She really loved XXX, her baby. She likes this child best because she had it with XXXXX, her only loved husband. Still, if you've read XXXX With The Wind, you would see that children make no difference in Scarlett's world. <br /><br />Quite frankly, it seemed to me like there was way too much going on without XXXXX. All anybody cares about is whether or not XXXXX and Scarlett get back together, and Scarlett took way too long to get to that. It is virtually nothing compared to Gone With The Wind, but then again what isn't? If you have read the novel, you will like that better than the movie.<br /><br />I would watch it, just because it is the sequel to Gone With The Wind, regardless of whether or not it's worthwhile. It may not satisfy you entirely, but it will get you some of the way there.
