I was fifteen." Eventually, he ended up working as an usher at the LA Paramount and within a few years fell back asswards into one of the greatest songwriting careers in the history of American music. 'Who Is XXXXX XXXXXXX (And Why Is Everybody Talking' About XXX?)' chronicles the legendary life of " the best songwriter of our generation." Writer/Director XXXX XXXXXXXXXX produces a 'who's who' of musical royalty, from Brian XXXXXX and XX XXXXXX to XXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXXX XXXXXX and XXX XXXXXX, "His voice was a medical instrument. It would heal you." Assorted archives include his 1969 appearance on 'Playboy After XXXX' and XXXXXXX's BBC special. The XXXX XXXXXX, brandy XXXXXXXXX, Smothers Brothers at the Troubadour comeback-show heckling debacle is one memorable recounting among so many they seem to virtually squeeze XXXXXXX's enchanting music out of this comprehensive and bitter-sweet bio-doc.<br /><br />"He was a wonderful perpetrator."<br /><br />"  I woke up three days later, getting a massage in Phoenix."
