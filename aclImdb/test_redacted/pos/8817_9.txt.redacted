This blaxploitation classic about a kung fu mama who travels to Hong Kong to avenge her brother's death offers everything you learned to expect from the genre. Playmate XXXXXXX XXXX (with a giant afro) really kicks ass and usually loses her clothes very quickly. If you don't take it all too seriously, the movie is great fun to watch. XXXX Shaw gives a solid performance, XXXXXXX XXXX is a little less convincing. XXX Grier she ain't.<br /><br />This is where XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX got his idea for the light switch scene in "XXXXXX XXXXX" from.<br /><br />The soundtrack by XXX XXXXXX is a gem and is frequently used in rap songs.
