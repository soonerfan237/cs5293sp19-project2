I actually though that XXXXX Snake Moan was great movie which takes place in the south. The story follows a man named XXXXXXX whose wife dumps him for his brother and finds Rae abandoned and beaten up on the side of the road. Lazarus finds out that XXX is a sex addict and was abused as a child so he decides to take matters into his own hands by tying up XXX with a chain to cure her of her wickedness. XXXXXX L Jackson and Christina Ricci have great chemistry together and their performances make you believe that through their struggles and search for redemption that Lazarus and Rae become best friends. I was also amazed by XXX's ability to play an electric guitar and being able to sing. S XXXXXX Merrkensen is great as Lazarus' love interest Angela, Justin Timberlake plays Rae's boyfriend Ronnie who is underused in the film but does the best that he can to deliver a fine performance.
