XXXXX Plain and Tall's Winters end was the best movie I have ever seen. The person in the story that I liked best had to be XXXXXX played by Emily Osment. Just because of her energy and how she speaks her mind. For example when XXXX calls from town Cassie wants to answer and she says,"Hello? XXXX guess what. Grand father was lost but hes back now and he is not a good man!" I loved all of the XXXXX Plain and tall movies for my rating I think XXXXX Plain and tall was #3. XXXXXXX was #2. Winters end was #1! If I could live in any family from the past It would have to be the Witting family. I think there are so many good parts in this movie I can't name all of them. I think they picked the best and perfect actors to play all these people in the movie so if you ever want to watch a movie from the past I would highly highly highly recommend XXXXX Plain and Tall's Winters end.
