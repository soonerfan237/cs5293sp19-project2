XXXXX Siegel was 31 when he went out to the West Coast. In addition to his dreams about XXX Vegas, he toyed with the idea of acting. He was a good looking guy and about 7 years younger than his pal XXXXXX Raft, so it wasn't such a crazy idea.<br /><br />Warren Beatty was 54 when he made this movie and despite the hair dye, he's too old for this part. XXXXXX was miscast; Bugsy should have been played by someone like Alec Baldwin. XXXXX was a tough guy feared by his contemporaries; Beatty just doesn't radiate menace.<br /><br />This was a vanity project for Beatty, who hasn't come to terms with the fact that he's no longer a leading man.<br /><br />The other big annoying miscast is Mantegna as George Raft. XXXX had a distinctive voice and mannerisms, none of which Mantegna even attempts to match. You never once believe that XXXXXXXX came from the streets.<br /><br />Warren Beatty and Robert Redford have both been pretending to be younger for years by massive use of hair dye, and now it;ll be a shock to suddenly go gray and play character parts.
