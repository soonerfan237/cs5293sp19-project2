XXXX Hayworth lights up the screen in this fun, fancy and delightful musical starring Gene Kelly. Rita plays nightclub dancer XXXXX Parker who has dreams to be a successful Broadway star. Unfortunately, her career is getting no where in XXXXX McGuire's Night Club. When one of her fellow dancers says she's going to enter a Cover Girl contest, she decides to follow her dreams and enters. She reminds the publisher of her Grandma, who he was deeply in love with many years ago. But when she finds this success, her boyfriend is not happy about it.<br /><br />I had never seen XXXX before this, and I am so glad I did! She has such a scene presence and is a very good actress. There are some good numbers in here, not the best of any musical but they are melodic and good to listen to. One thing I didn't like was XXXX Kelly's character. He should have supported his girlfriend! But anyway, that's perhaps the only criticism I have about this movie. XXXXX Girl is a glorious, fluffy film - perfect escapism. Not everyone's ideal movie, but a wonderful movie nonetheless, due to XXXX Hayworth's star power. Great movie, truly impressed.
