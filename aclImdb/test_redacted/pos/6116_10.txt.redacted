For all viewers out there who have slammed XXXX Waters for creating a film like Pink Flamingos, just stop. It's getting you nowhere. Has anyone ever cared to stop and think about the ambition and dedication Mr.Waters possesses. To gather your best friends up and to create a movie just to gross out thousands of viewers all over shows this man has a great deal of ambition inside himself. Just read his biography XXXXX Value.

Maybe it wasn't just the fact that XXXX made this film to gross people out, it was to prove that there can be something such as good bad taste>
