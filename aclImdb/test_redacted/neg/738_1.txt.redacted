It is hard for a lover of the novel Northanger Abbey to sit through this BBC adaptation and to keep from throwing objects at the TV screen-in fact, if XXXX Austen herself were to see this, she would be somewhat amused and possibly put out. XXXXXX Wadey's adaptation has made Northanger Abbey into what it satirized, the Gothic novel (and the readers of Gothic novels).<br /><br />The role of Catherine Morland in the adaptation is portrayed fairly closely to Austen's Catherine, a open-hearted, generous girl whose imagination simply runs away with her. But the XXXXX Tilney of the novel is not a snuff-taking, cane-wielding, sappy-line-making hero of a Gothic novel-he is a tease, a nearly-handsome man with a messy room and a living (that's right, XXXXX Tilney is a clergyman, a charm that is completely dropped from the script). Some of the best scenes from novel, when XXXXX, completely deadpan, outrageously teases the literally-minded Catherine on diction, journals, Mrs. Radcliffe, etc., are not portrayed in the adaptation. A large section of XXXXX's personality is lost when those scenes are not adapted. Besides, XXXXX Firth's appearance is not accurate-Henry Tilney is supposed to be 24 or 25, dark hair and a brown skin, not 35 or 40 and blond.<br /><br />There are so many other absurdities within the adaptation that invoke surprise and disgust-who is the Marchioness, and what is she doing in the story?! Why is XXXX Thorpe less of a dunce and more of a schemer? Why is XXXXXXXXXX Abbey a castle? Catherine of the novel, with her romantic visions, expects hidden passages and dark tapestries, but is very disappointed to discover that XXXXXXXXXX Abbey is actually a comfortable, modern house-another element of satire! Why portray General Tilney as a drunk? Why does XXXXXXXXX have those strange visions of Mrs. Allen threading her finger, etc.? Catherine's imagination only runs away with her at Northanger, with XXXXX there to correct her gently. And lastly, why are so many facts concerning the XXXXXX family and Mrs. XXXXXX's death altered unnecessarily? To make the story more `horrible?' All of these oddities and more simply are too strange to be overlooked.<br /><br /> >
