The Hell's Angels did come out the losers in this movie. XXXXX stated to the director that NOBODY does this to the Angles and gets away with it. His version was the two dudes were to be shotgunned to death, but his suggestion was ignored. They were stoops to even appear, much less be "technical advisers" in a stink-bomb of a movie like this. XXXX's Angles on JAP bikes? C'mon! (although in Sonny's autobiography he says, "F$#K XXXXXX Davidson!" and that if they was smart, they would be riding Hondas. (ST1100) Read his auto...he HATES XXXXXXX. Can you imagine the Angels whispering into town on their sewing-machine sounding Jap bikes? Not too intimidating. They would get laughed out of town.
