This adaptation for TV was a wonderful vehicle for XXXX Irwin to show his ability to perform physical humor. With the backdrop of a struggle between an actor and his writer/director, XXXX uses his clowning antics to showcase a variety of skills including hat tricks, pantomime, dance and various physical devices.<br /><br />Although it takes a big swipe at the entertainment industry and his craft, it is engrossing for people of all walks and ages.<br /><br />This work was televised as a PBS special. XXXX performed a piece of it on the Tonight Show, but out of context it did not go over well.
