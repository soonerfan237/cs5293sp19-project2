This film is about aging XXXXXX in post war Tokyo. XXXX, played by the incredible XXXXXX XXXXXXXX, lends money to two other ex XXXXXX, Tamae (Chikako Hosokawa) and XXXXX (Yuko Mochizuki) and they resent the way she is somewhat smug about it. Tamae has a son, XXXXX a daughter, who during the film announce they're leaving them while XXXX, never a mother, gets visits from two men in her past who, it turns out, just want money from her. Its a compelling tale of what choices you make, what you do to get through life and who you're responsible and beholden to. XXXXXX XXXXXXXX has always been in my eyes one of the greatest character actresses ever from any country and she plays the mostly unyielding, less than compassionate XXXX with an air of superiority that makes you not like her, but at the same time almost envy her. At a time when great films were made by XXX, XXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXX, amongst others, XXX XXXXXX is right up there with him. If you have a region free DVD player, you should attempt to find the two Naruse box sets released in England. I think this film was a great character study of women who are in danger of being irrelevant. That they are really not makes this film a veritable masterpiece.
