And thus was born the most amorous skunk ever to grace the silver screen. While the plot has an abused cat painting himself like a skunk and inadvertently attracting XXXX Le Pew (called Henry here), XXXX certainly steals the show. No doubt XXXXX Jones realized that this love-seeking member of the genus Mephitis had that special something necessary to be a star in his own right, and so he cast Pepe in "For Scent-imental Reasons" four years later, firmly establishing PLP's enduring presence on screens everywhere.<br /><br />So, while "Odor-Able Kitty" may be a place holder otherwise, I try to imagine watching it for the very first time in 1945. Could anyone have guessed that this supporting character would soon join the ranks of Bugs, XXXXX, Porky, and the rest? Whether or not anyone did, XXXX remains one of the most likable characters to this day. C'est l'amour!
