This one is a very solid XXXXXXXX Scott Western. He plays XXX Masterson and goes to Liberal, Kansas to clean up the town. He becomes good friends with XXXXXX Ryan who played a very, straight up leading man role. It was not until after this that XXXXXX Ryan began playing much darker roles. In fact, in 1947 XXXXXXXX Scott made one other movie which was not a western and never made anything but westerns after that until he retired in 1962. This movie has good pacing and builds up to the climax steadily. I can't say any more as it would give away the plot. Be sure to see this one. 8/10
