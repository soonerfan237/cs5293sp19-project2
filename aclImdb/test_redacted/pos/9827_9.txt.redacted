I really enjoyed "XXXXXX Hearts". It was shocking to see such a low rating on IMDB, but chacun a son gout and all that. I am a big fan of XXXXXXXX Ford, but I do have to admit that he was ill cast in this movie, and the reason I gave it 9 instead of 10. XXXXXXX Scott Thomas, though, was just wonderful. She was believable and beautiful, in spite of being made up for half the movie like she'd been crying for days. Could "Random XXXXXX" have been better? Sure, but it is very much worth seeing as it is.
