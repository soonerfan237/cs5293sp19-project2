The most generic, surface-level biography you could hope for. XXXXX's impersonation of Holly is accurate -- but who wants to hear Gary XXXXX sing "Maybe Baby"? Typically, the members of the Hollies are used for comic relief and melodrama (Smith and XXXXXX, respectively) instead of as people or even characters. When XXXXX uses a string section, the old jewish-looking guys who come in tell him he's using the same techniques as Mozart. It's just this kind of cheeky statement that makes film biographies like this (and "Amadeus", about the aforementioned Mozart) so worthless. Some entertainment can be derived from XXXXX's excellent styles and songs done in a B-variation.
