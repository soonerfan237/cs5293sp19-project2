Beware, XX XXXXXX is an experimental studio film from the early fifties and was directed by a man, XXXXX XXXXXX, better known for his set designs. XXXXXX XXXX plays a handyman who is hired by XXX XXXXXX to do some housework for her. The problem is that he is a psychopathic murderer and doesn't know it. XXXX XXXXXX is an empathetic soul and tries to win XXXX over, to little avail. He is not the sort of man compassion could help or cure. Thus we have an interesting situation of two people who basically mean well, but one of them can't do well because there is something wrong with him. He suffers periodic blackouts during which he commits acts of violence, which he later forgets. <br /><br />Essentially the effect XXXX has on XXXXXX is that of the hunter and his prey, or in another sense a sadist. The audience finds out early on that XXXX is a mad killer, but it takes XXXXXX much longer. Thus we must live with this knowledge as we watch poor XXXX XXXXXX try everything in her power to 'win' XXXX over in order to make things work, get the job done, get on with life. But getting on with things isn't in XXXX's makeup, as he is incapable of any but the most rudimentary forms of normality, and as soon as there is an opening his paranoia asserts itself. <br /><br />As a study in mental illness the movie isn't too impressive. What it's superlative at is showing the effect of major mental illness, with dangerous psychopathology in the mix, and its effect on a normal person. In this regard the film is realistic and compassionate, though relentlessly logical in that we know XXXXXX can't 'fix' XXXX, yet we want her to. The result is that, if one is willing, one can get extremely involved in this film emotionally if one can put aside, so to speak, its melodramatic structure.<br /><br />XXXXXX shows us, gradually, the layout the XXXXXX house , a forbidding gothic monstrosity that never feels like a home. We become familiar with staircase, kitchen and pantry; and we come to know which windows XXXX XXXXXX can use for an escape and which ones she can't.
