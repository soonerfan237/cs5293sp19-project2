We just finished screening XX XXXXXXX in Australia. A phenomenal piece of film work. We look forward to seeing many more films from XXX XXXXX in the future. It was wonderful to see such a well put together film with such suspense and a story that shall remain an instant classic. Seeing a film with great quality truly outlines XXXXX's serious potential and his adept skill as a writer, actor, director, and filmmaker. XXXXX has impressed many with his triumphant performance in "blood in and blood out" and now he has proved to all who have see his works his potential to become a critically acclaimed film maker with genuine artistic control. With his lead role XXXX XXXXXXX being a perfect combination between XXXX XXXXX from "Blood in Blood Out" and XX XXXXXX from "Scarface" the film will do wonders for us here in Australia.
