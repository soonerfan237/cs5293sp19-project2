XXXX Jane Austen ought to be glad she's not around to see this dreadful wreck of an adaptation. So many great XXXX Austen movies have come out recently that this one deserves to be permanently buried along with two other movies I despise-The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit and the 1969 version of David Copperfield. My main beef with the movie is that it completely misses the point of the book. XXXX Austen was poking fun at the Gothic mania in her society, and much of the novel is tongue in cheek. The movie, however, is serious and comes across terribly melodramatically. The lighthearted, fun-poking flavor of Austen's writing is completely and conspicuously absent from this ponderous foray iinto horror meets period drama. The scenes of XXXXXXXXX's imagination are both gratuitous and uninteresting. Also, XXXXX Tilney is dreadfully unappealing. Why, I ask, would anyone fall for him? If you are looking for a fun-filled XXXX Austen evening, watch Emma instead!
