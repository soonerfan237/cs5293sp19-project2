Friz XXXXXXX's 'All Abir-r-r-d' is one of the best XXXXXXXXX and XXXXXX cartoons. Unlike the many repetitive cartoons in the series which simply transplant the same tired gags to a new setting, 'All Abir-r-r-d' makes the most of its concept. XXXXXX and XXXXXXXXX are domestic pets who are being sent unattended across country by train. With both a watchful official and a vicious bulldog to deal with, XXXXXXXXX has his work cut out. The XXXXXXXXX and XXXXXX cartoons always benefited from some extra participants and 'All Abir-r-r-d' is a good example of how much these additional characters help. Although they are not especially memorable creations, they throw some more obstacles in XXXXXXXXX's path and make for a more interesting battle. This early XXXXXXXXX and XXXXXX short presses many of the right buttons and, while XXXXXX is often particularly irritating with his forced cuteness, there's some deliciously violent antics between XXXXXXXXX and the dog, culminating in a surprisingly brutal climax which is unfortunately marred by a final unfunny non-quip by XXXXXX.
