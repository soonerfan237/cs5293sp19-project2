I saw this movie when I was a kid and have been looking for it ever since.It rates up there with XXXXX in The Sky, XXXXXX XXXXXXX and XXXXXX XXXXX as a must see in movies that showcased the awesome talent of African XXXXXXXns.In the 60s the local Los Angeles TV stations would have a movie of the week and some stations would show the same movie for 5 days.Porgy and XXXX was one of them and my whole family would be there all 5 nights in front of the TV and only moved on the commercials.South XXXXXXX,Oklahoma and The Sound of Music are all musical classics that you can pick up at any video store. It would be a shame to let this collection of some of the best talent XXXXXXX had to offer be forgotten or locked in a vault.Please make the film available to the public.
