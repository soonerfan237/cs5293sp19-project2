Avoid this one! It is a terrible movie. So what if it is very exciting? All it is is just pointless murders. And the whole thing with XXXXX and Michael's curse, that was the absolute worst thing they could possibly do to the series! Why couldn't they leave XXXXXXX's story a mystery? He's supposed to be the Boogeyman, not part of some stupid cult!! Ugh! Thank God for XXXXXXXXX H20, which wiped out XXXXXXXXX 3-6! They all sucked! But anyway, if you see this movie, please expect no more than pointless murders and gore.
