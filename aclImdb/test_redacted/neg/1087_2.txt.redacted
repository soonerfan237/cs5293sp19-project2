This hokey movie left me groaning after just about any exchange of dialogue or plot complication. XXXXXXXX Arquette, though pleasing to look at, gives a below par performance from her usual mediocrity. My friends and I have coined the phrase "XXXXXX Rangoon" to mean anything really bad. A lowpoint for XXXXXXX.
