I was a child when I saw this serial, a bit after seen XXXX XXXXXX one, both characters performed by the same Buster XXXXXX, and I must acknowledge that these films have always been part of the best entertainment I've ever had. The fight against XXXXXXX XXXX was one thing but I was more interested to know about the final fate of the love triangle of XXXXX with XXXX and XXXX. XXXXX came and persuaded XXXX to forget XXXXX, very innocent termination of her obsession for good-looking XXXXX. The serial has no offensive and really violent scenes and can be watched by all audiences. Another thing is that I learned floating in water looking the way XXXXXX did it when fighting against shark men. The soundtrack was also nice although it was used previously in another film of XXXXX XXXXXXX's XXXXXXXXXXXX. It would be nice to have the DVD of this serial provided that it comes with subtitles in Spanish (not yet available).
