No doubt that the indie flick XXXXX XXXXXX is one of the better independent films I've seen in a long time. The highlight for me was the performance of XXXX XXXXX. I first saw XXXX, or "Big XXXXie" as he was called in XXXXX XXXXXXXXXX's hit indie, "This Thing Of Ours". Thankfully, the "XXXXX XXXXXX" filmmaker(s) did the same and utilized XXXX's undeniable skills in a principle (principal?) role. Out came a performance (on camera and voice-over utilization as well) that shows worthy of big-budget studio roles in the very near future. It's refreshing to see a trained actor who is committed to the trade, prove the same to the audience. Keep up the good work Big XXXXie and we'll be seeing you in Hollywood real soon! Not bad for a kid from Canarsie, huh?
