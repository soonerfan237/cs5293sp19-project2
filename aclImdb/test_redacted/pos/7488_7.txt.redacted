A vehemently cynical, sarcastic and intense film, mocking and imitating the style of XXXX XXXXXXX and stylized gangster films, Thursday is an entertaining, off-putting and hilarious thrill-ride. An amazingly eclectic mix of over-the-top characters and bizarrely entertaining situations, this day-in-the-life of a gunman trying to go straight proves to be a worthy addition to the series of films that attempts to mimic the genius of XXXXXXXXX's dark-humored masterpiece XXXX XXXXXXX.<br /><br />XXXX (XXXXX XXXXXXXX) stops by XXXXX's (XXXXXX XXXX) house to catch up on old times. XXXXX was a former gunman for drug dealers who has since reformed, become an architect, married a successful businesswoman (XXXXX XXXXXXXX), and is now contemplating adopting a child. XXXX, who still has ties to the gangster underworld, leaves a briefcase full of drugs at XXXXX's house while he borrows his car to run a few errandsÂ… a.k.a. unfinished business. Disgusted and angered by the introduction of drugs into his home, XXXXX flushes them all down the kitchen sink. That's when, one at a time, XXXX's double-crossed accomplices, rapping Rastafarian drug messengers, and crooked cops all come a-knocking for the unsuspecting XXXXX, who is about to have one unbelievable Thursday.<br /><br />The film opens with a hilarious sequence in a gas station in which XXXX is looking for the best deal for a cup of coffee. After pondering which size cup to get, a fiasco breaks out with the cashier when he demands a free snackie cake and uses a $50 bill to pay. Resulting in comically brilliant bloodshed, the situation goes from bad to worse when a cop intervenes and is caught in the most unusual of circumstances. This opening segment establishes the perfect mood for the rest of the film, which never takes itself too seriously and includes outrageous characters that seem self-aware of their own existence in this nonsensical gangster flick.<br /><br />The film is broken into segments based on various events and times during the course of one day. This effect is much like XXXX XXXXXXX, which is a similarly given chapters, although Thursday doesn't mess with chronological order except for the occasional flashback. Also like XXXXXXXXX, music magnificently introduces each scene and each character. Oddly humorous creatures, such as the Jamaican hit-man pizza delivery guy that raps over the phone and shares his hashish, and XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX's narcissistic Dallas, who attempts to rape XXXXX, add humor to each event regardless of how horrifying and unnerving some of the coincidences are. When XXXXXX XXXXXX's calmly spine-chilling crooked cop XXXXXXX is introduced, the careful staging and intricate setup is fully assembled, and XXXXX's sticky situation becomes even more daring and laudable.<br /><br />Definitely a wannabe XXXX XXXXXXX, with plenty of violence, witty dialogue and extremely creepy antagonists, Thursday does some things right, but other attempts at homage may be going just far enough as to suggest rip-off. A flashback sequence that shows XXXXX shooting up baddies and sporting a hairstyle that exactly matches XXXX XXXXXXXX's do in XXXX XXXXXXX is easily one step too far.<br /><br />- XXXX XXXXXX, www.MoviePulse.net
