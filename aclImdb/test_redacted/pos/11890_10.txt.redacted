I have seen this film more then once. Actually El XXXXXXX was one of the best feature films that I have seen in a great deal of time.<br /><br />There was a big cast XXXXXXXX XXXXX, XXXX XXXXXXX, XXXX XXXXXX, and XXXXXX XXXXX who really shined like a real star in this part of Kilo.<br /><br />I heard this film was shot for under two million dollars. I have seen films shot for 33 million that cant compare to the quality and production value.<br /><br />XXXXXX XXXXX why are you not getting offers and more film work!!! EXCELLENT JOB!!!!!!!!!! I cant wait to see the sequel, and I hope it has the same action.<br /><br />XXXXXXXX XXXXX has made a cult classic character with Sabeva.<br /><br />XXXXXX XXXXX moves coolly in every scene much like the movie stars of the 40's and 50's So sick of seeing these non charismatic actors like XXX XXXXXXX getting all of these films when there is talent like this that have something to show. a great film.<br /><br />GO GO GO KICK SOME BUT IN SALES EL PADRINO!!!
