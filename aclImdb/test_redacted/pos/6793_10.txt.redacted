This is the greatest movie if you want inspiration on following your heart and never giving up on your dream. XXXXXXXXX Taylor is XXXXXX and in her prime (of her childhood, at least), XXXXXX XXXXXX is a cynical friend who eventually becomes her trainer and they go off to the Grand National steeplechase with her beloved horse "the Pi"--short for "Pirate"--only to have XXXXXX become the jockey and have a chance at victory. To those of you who have not seen it yet, I won't give away the ending but you should see it and once you do you'll love it. Notice a very young XXXXXX XXXXXXXX as XXXXXX's eldest sister.
