First, IFC runs XXXX and Country, and now this. The difference between that stinker and this Pink Panther rip-off is that XXXX and Country was watchable. This isn't.<br /><br />I can only surmise that the cast signed up for this so they could goof off in Europe on somebody else's dime. Belushi is especially irritating. His scene with Candy (doing a Z-grade XXX DeLuise) was torture. Speaking of torture, five minutes of the talentless XXXXXXXX, and I bet the prisoners at Gitmo would crack like walnuts!<br /><br />The real "Crime" (besides this being green-lighted) is XXXXXXXX's character: a mousy wife who takes a Monte Carlo casino for a half-million bucks! If you buy that, I have some oceanfront property in Arizona you might be interested in!
