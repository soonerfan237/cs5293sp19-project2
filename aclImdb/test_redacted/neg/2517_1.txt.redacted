XXXXXXX Visconti, the artist with the sword. Courage should be the first word associated with his entire opus. Film. Theater. Music. Revolutions, artistic, cultural, personal. A legacy with powerful consequences and endless ramifications. He introduced the neorealism through the work of an American novelist XXXXX Cain in "Ossesione" He gave Anna Magnani the most extraordinarily beautiful close ups of her career. He gave us XXXXX Delon and Maria Callas. But the last word about his life and work rests on the talents of a certain XXXX Low and the voice of Helmut Berger. What a terrible fate.<br /><br />For those interested, there is a 61 minute documentary by director XXXXX Lizzani (a man who really knew Visconti) titled LUCHINO VISCONTI A PORTRAIT. It is out on DVD distributed by XXXXX Entertainment
