I saw this movie when I was very young living in Houston, Texas. I really enjoyed this movie, and I wrote to XXXX XXXXXX in Hollywood, and I told her how much I enjoyed seeing her in this movie. She sent me an autographed photo. This movie was directed by XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX, and besides XXXX XXXXXX in the starring role. It also stars XXXXX XXXXXXX, XXXXX XXXXX, and XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX. It was released in 1951 in color and is 81 minutes long. XXXX XXXXXX was married to XXXXXX XXXXXX. She also starred in "Viva XXXXXX" with XXXXXX XXXXXX, XXXXXXX XXXXX, who won an Oscar for playing the role XXXXXX's brother (XXXXXX XXXXXX starred as XXXXXX) (1952). And she also starred in "Captain from Castile" (1947) with XXXXX XXXXX. Since then I've been trying to find a place where it is available, but so far I have not been successful. Does anybody have any suggestions about where I can find and purchase this movie? It this comment contains spoilers, I am unaware of it.
