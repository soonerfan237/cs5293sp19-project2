Once you sit down to see this film " A Cannon for Cordoba " you get the feeling it's going to be a great. The reason? The film begins with a rousing score by noted composer XXXXX XXXXXXXXX who gave us such memorable themes as 'The XXXXX XXXXXX and the Magnificent Seven.' Indeed, when you read the opening credits headlining the cast is none other than XXXXXX XXXXXXX as Capt. XXX XXXXXXX, you know it's going to have action and lot's of it. Furthermore when you see actor XXXX XXXXXX playing General XXXX XX XXXXXXXX, you know you're in for a heroic saga. The story is taken from the annals of the Mexican revolution and involves the U.S. in a border town dispute with the Mexican bandits who cross the Rio Grande in the early 1900s. Among the most brazen of the rebel leaders is General XXXXXXX (Raf Vallone). With his army of Mexican revolutionaries, he attacks Pershing, kills his men and steals some valuable artillery pieces. Since the United States Army cannot enter Mexico legally, Capt. XXXXXXX is sent on what is slated a suicide mission, without orders and without aid from Pershing. His mission is to retrieve the Cannons, destroy a rebel stronghold and bring XXXXXXX back alive. Selecting the roughest, toughest, most experienced, certainly the most insolent men available, XXXXXXX enters Mexico and attacks the nearly impregnable fortress. Dramatic action follows, as does lots of explosive excitement. If one is asks for criticism, I would say the choice of heavies. Vallone and XXXX XXXXX are not very menacing. Not so with the men who side with XXXXXXX. XXXX Duel and XXX XXXXXX (Who is superb.) Nevertheless, this movie is recommended as good viewing. ****
