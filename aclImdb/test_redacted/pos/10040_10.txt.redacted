Although "They Died with their Boots On" is not entirely historically accurate it is a very entertaining western. Not only is Flynn the perfect Custer, the character actors are superb. Besides the action portion of the movie XXXXX and DeHavilland's love scenes are very touching and believable.(XXXXX and DeHavilland were very fond of each other in real life). XXXXX was always so tormented for being not taken seriously if only he knew that there were very few actors who could play the characters he played and play them well!
