This is one of XXXXX's most underrated films in my opinion, its an awesome heartwarming film, with a neat story and an amazing performance from XXXXX Willis!. All the characters are great, and I thought XXXXXX and Spencer Breslin were just awesome together, plus Bruce XXXXXX is simply amazing in this!. This is definitely one of XXXXX's best comedic performances (The waaaaaaaaaamabulance thing was great) and I thought it was very well written and made as well, plus The finale is especially cool!. It's good natured and it was cool how you can see XXXXXXX's (Willis) character change throughout the film! plus the ending was pretty good. I think this should be higher then 6.0 and it's one of the best Disney films I have ever seen! plus it has many surprising moments throughout. All the characters are extremely likable, and it also has a cute love story angle too it as well, plus XXXXX and Spencer Breslin both had some really funny lines (Holy Smokes!). This is one of XXXXX's most underrated films in my opinion, its an awesome heartwarming film, with a neat story and an an amazing performance from XXXXX Willis and I say its a must see!. The Direction is great!. XXX Turteltaub does a great job here with really good camera work, and just keeping the film at a very fast pace. The Acting is excellent!. XXXXX Willis is amazing as always and is amazing here, he gives one of his best comedic performances, is hilarious had wonderful chemistry with both Spencer Breslin and Emily Mortimer, had some funny lines, and was dead on throughout the movie, he was one of the main reasons I liked this movie so much! (XXXXXX Rules!!!!!!!). XXXXXXX Breslin is fantastic as the younger version of Russell, he was very funny and didn't get on my nerves once, he is one of the better child actors out there!. Emily Mortimer is good as XXX and was really cute I liked her she had decent chemistry with Bruce too. Lily XXXXXX is funny as Janet I liked her quite a bit. XXXX Smart is good with what she had to do, which was not much. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall a must see!. **** out pf 5
