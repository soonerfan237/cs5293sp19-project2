A young man, named XXXXX, has run away from home and meets a drifter, named Bix, who agrees to tag along with XXXXX and watch out for him... and his money. They end up in a small town where they meet XXXXXX - a shy, naive girl working in her father's diner. Bix starts seeing XXXXXX but he plans on leaving soon (because he's a drifter, see? He's no good! Understand?). Meanwhile, the town creep, Jesse (played by a perfectly casted XXXX Elam), keeps showing up at the diner and bothering Carrie. XXXXX keeps inadvertently picking up whores left and right (because he's loaded with money Â– he has almost a hundred dollars!) whom XXX has to constantly chase away (there are a lot of ambiguously gay overtones between Danny and XXX in this flick). Eventually, XXX and Danny decide to leave town but trouble is a-brewing, due to Jesse the creep.<br /><br />My review of the movie itself: a terrible, dated "Troubled Youth" flick from the '50s.<br /><br />My review of the MST3K version of the movie: I've got to say that this is one of the best episodes of MST3K ever. The riffing is dead-on, all the time. Except for the somewhat downbeat ending, this movie is easy material for XXXX and the Bots, especially Danny's constant screw-ups that Bix has to rescue him from. The host segments are pretty good too, especially the segment with the `Train Song.' Hopefully, XXXXX releases this episode to home video one day.
