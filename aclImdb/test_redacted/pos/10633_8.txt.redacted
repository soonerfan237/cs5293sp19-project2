XXXXX Kohut is a woman with deep sexual problems. At the start of the film, we see her arriving home late. When her older mother protests, XXXXX goes into a frenzy, attacking the older woman without pity. XXXXX, as it turns out, is a musical teacher of a certain renown in the conservatory where she teaches. When we next see her, she is the model of composure, but she shows a cruel side in the way she attacks a young male student because she feels he is wasting his time, and hers. The same goes for the insecure XXXX, a talented girl who XXXXX hates, maybe because she sees in the young woman a promise that she is not willing to promote.<br /><br />At the end of the day, we watch XXXXX as she goes into an amusement area and proceeds to one of the cabins where pornographic material is shown. XXXXX is transfixed as she watches the things that are being performed on the screen. On another occasion, XXXXX comes to a drive-in where a movie is in progress. Her attention goes toward a parked car in which, two lovers are performing a sex act. The camera lingers on XXXXX as she is lost in reverie watching what the two lovers are doing, until she is surprised by the young man inside the car. XXXXX flees horrified she's been discovered.<br /><br />When a wealthy couple invites XXXXX to perform in a recital in their opulent home, she meets an eager young man, XXXXXX, who is related to the hosts. XXXXXX is immediately taken with XXXXX's playing; the young man is a talented pianist himself. His eagerness to compliment XXXXX is met with skepticism on her part. XXXXXX decides to audition for XXXXX's master class, and is accepted.<br /><br />Thus begins XXXXXX pursuit of XXXXX, who is taken aback when she realizes what the young man's motives really are. In turn, XXXXX, begins to fantasize about XXXXXX in ways that only her mind could, imagining what she would like him do when, and if, they get together. XXXXXX gets turned off by the letter XXXXX has written to him, detailing sexual acts that are repugnant to the young man.<br /><br />The film's ending, reminded us of the last sequence of XXX XXXXXX's current "Cache". We are taken to a concert hall where XXXXX is going to perform. She is seen stalking the lobby looking for the arrival of XXXXXX, who goes on into the hall without noticing her. XXXXX's expression to the camera reveals a lot more of her state of mind in that last minutes of the film. As she flees the lobby area after inflicting a wound on herself, the camera abandons her and concentrates on the building's facade that seems to stay on the screen for a long time.<br /><br />"La Pianiste" is a personal triumph for XXXXXXXX XXXXXXX.
