A woman and her aunt go to Scotland to locate her evasive fianc√©. This is a much-maligned film because of its denouement, but up to that point, it's interesting, well-acted, eerie, and with fine set design (by XXXXXXX XXXXXXX XXXXXXX, developed for 3-D projection). XXXXXXXX XXXXX is captivating and genteel, sort of a chic British XXXXXXX XXXXXX, still in love with XXXXXXX XXXXXXX, who is hiding a family secret in his forbidding castle; there are even bats in the belfry! It moves leisurely until the final extraordinary set-piece, when XXXXX and her aunt (XXXXXXXXX XXXXX, also the narrator), sneak out of the castle in the night to venture into the maze and find what they're looking for in its center. As a kid, I always remembered this sequence - there's nothing scarier (or claustrophobic) than not finding your way out of a 10-foot high maze of hedges. Naturally, the two women get separated, setting the stage for engrossing suspense with horrific music. The final result is mildly disappointing really, since XXXXXXX's epilogue at the end makes some sense to all the goings-on, even provoking sympathy. Worth seeing.
