A spin off comedy talk show from the creators of 'XXXXX XXXXXXXX's XXXXXXXXX' The new series, XXX to XXX with XXXX XXXXXXX, focuses on XXXXX's manager, publisher and publicity agent, as played by XXXXXXX Ayoade.<br /><br />Nightclub owner, restaurateur, publisher, international playboy - XXXX XXXXXXX is a one-man brand. <br /><br />After his co-funded Channel 4 television hit XXXXX XXXXXXXX's XXXXXXXXX he now invites you into his luxury penthouse flat for an all-new, entertaining and immensely stylish TV talk show.<br /><br />XXX to XXX with XXXX XXXXXXX will feature all Dean's remaining celebrity friends, as well as plenty of live music and fine fish-dish cuisine in a show that reeks of class - but not fish!<br /><br />I attended two of the live recordings and it had me in stitches. There are distinct comparisons to XXXX XXXXXXXXX's 'Knowing me Knowing you' in the layout but XXXXXXX Ayoade and XXXX XXXXXXX's unique writing style take it to another level.<br /><br />If your a fan of XXXXXXXXX then you can't miss it. Catch it when its aired late this summer
