I was enchanted by XXXXX's debut. I hope that we'll soon see more of his work. I was lucky enough to catch the film during its brief NYC run and it struck me as a worthy successor to such downtown 80s flicks as Desperately Seeking XXXXX and After XXXXX, but with a gentle European whimsey that made it fresh and fun. A strong ensemble cast playing mostly against type was a pleasure. And I thought the complexly inter-threaded plots were just right. XXXXXX XXXXXXXX puts in her best performance since King of Comedy, while XXXXX XXXXXXXX is hilarious, and Ling Bai touching. See it.
