Most of us kids growing up in the 40's or 50's were western buffs but this was one that had escaped me until seeing on the Movies for Men Channel today. I loved the film's story, cinematography as well as the superb casting of XXX XXXXXXX and XXXXX XXXXX Jr. in the lead roles along with the ever dependable XXXX XXXX. Apparently this movie was the inspiration for the later television series 'Wagon Train' which featured XXXX once again as the boss of the wagon trains heading west. XXXXXXX steals the film with his horse riding skills and it's nice to see an actor doing his own stunts like XXX does in this movie. Other notables include the lovely XXXXXX XXX as XXXXXX and an early non speaking role for XXXXX XXXXXX who later became famous for his XXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXX role in 'Gunsmoke.' If you like films of this genre you can't fail to like this one.
