I don't know about the rest of the viewers of this movie but personally I'm dead sick and tired of XXXXXX Seagal films. When XXXXX the Law came out, it was a great action film. Wahoo. Now in the Patriot, XXXXXX Seagal plays XXXXXX Seagal from Above the Law. I get tired of seeing no character changes. It's the same character, time after time, after time. He needs change. This movie was probably one of the worst action films I have ever seen. Calling it an action movie is giving it almost too much credit because there's too few action scenes and they're spread far apart throughout the film. I guess they wanted to go for some drama but it was a meaningless try as the film portrays nothing but the regular squinty-eyed-Steven-Seagal we've seen thousands of times over. Get a new look and lose the pony tail is all I have to say, I definitely do not recommend viewing this film in any form, go out to eat, heck, rent XXXXXX goes to Vegas but do not under any circumstances rent this movie under the precept that Seagal will make a great performance.
