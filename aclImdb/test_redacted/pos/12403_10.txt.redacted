This film is like "The Breakfast Club" meets "XXX XXXX." It's got one plot twist after another with XXXXXX XXXXXX, XXXXX XXXXXXX, and XXXXX XXXXX delivering really great performances. However, this movie is not for everyone. If you don't like movies that "go all the way" with regards to violence, then don't watch the last twenty minutes. My wife had to leave the room. Of course, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. This is a really gritty, realistic teen drama. I can't believe it came from B-Movie king XXXXX XXXXXX. This film is a must-see for those who are not faint of heart. Highly recommended.
