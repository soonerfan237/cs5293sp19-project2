I love this movie, one of my all time favorites. XXX XXXXXX as XXXXX O'Moyne is sweet and trouble-free. She believes that praying to XXXXX XXXX will solve all her and her friends troubles. The sub-plot of the dastardly bad man to get her father's property is funny and clever. Her brothers are what kind of brothers any girl would love to have. Also, look for "XXXX XXX" as her mother, a strong Irish woman who won't leave her house that she brought her family up in. They don't make them like this anymore, that's for sure.
