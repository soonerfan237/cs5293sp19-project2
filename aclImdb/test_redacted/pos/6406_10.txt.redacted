XXX West, for too short a time was "appointment TV" for my family. I'd stop by XXX Lobster and pick up a Party Tray for the night it was on. The irony of the situation was that I was working for a XXX Affiliate at the time, and every one at the station was incensed at them not renewing the show. Everyone in that cast was excellent. Fisher XXXXXXX... perfect. Who couldn't fail to identify with an "everyman" who dreams of being a writer in Key West? XXXXXXXX Tilly was always remarkable (and she is one HECK of a Texas Hold'em Player). You can still find the pilot episode on YouTube. Wish they'd post the Hurricane one. That episode alone, should have won an Emmy, as well as the rest of the cast.
