Seems to have been made as a vehicle for W.C. Fields and XXXXX XXXXXXXX and they dominate it. Fields already has his film character well developed. XXXXX XXXXXXXX seems to dance through the film and her acting reminds me of XXXX XXXXXXXX, who also worked a long time under D.W. Griffith. Typical of later Griffith films technically.<br /><br />Later remade as Poppy (the original title) with Fields in the same role.
