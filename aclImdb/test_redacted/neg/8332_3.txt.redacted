The director is sweet, as is his co-directing wife XXXXX Geffen, but their movie sucks. It has its moments (and some pretty girls), but there is too much of everything: "Am√©lie" meets "Breaking the waves" meets "XXXXXXX at the beach". You walk away wanting to know more about the wedding photographer, and about the girl who likes it best when nothing happens, be it in movies or in real life. Instead, you get a suicidal writer, a neurotic actress and an illegal-immigrant-come-social-worker with a heart of gold. It feels like there's more than one truly touching story hidden in the script, but at face value it's a truckload of wasted story lines and sentimental bullshit. XXXX to sit out as it is.
