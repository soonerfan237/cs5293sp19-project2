The original The Man XXX XXXX XXX XXXX brought XXXXXX XXXXXXXXX acclaim for the first time outside of the United Kingdom. Of course part of the reason for the acclaim was that folks marveled how XXXXXXXXX on such a skimpy budget as compared to lavish Hollywood products was able to provide so much on the screen. The original film was shot inside a studio.<br /><br />For whatever reason he chose this of all his films to remake, XXXXXXXXX now with an international reputation and a big Hollywood studio behind him (Paramount)decided to see what The Man XXX XXXX XXX XXXX would be like with a lavish budget. This is shot on location in Marrakesh and London and has two big international names for box office. This was XXXXX XXXXXXX's third of four XXXXXXXXX films and his only teaming with XXXXX Day and her only XXXXXXXXX film.<br /><br />I do wonder why XXXXXXXXX never used XXXXX again. At first glance she would fit the profile of blond leading ladies that XXXXXXXXX favored. Possibly because her wholesome screen image was at odds with the sophistication XXXXXXXXX also wanted in his blondes. <br /><br />XXXXX does some of her best acting ever in The Man XXX XXXX XXX XXXX. Her best scene is when her doctor husband XXXXX XXXXXXX gives her a sedative before telling her their son has been kidnapped by an English couple who befriended them in Morocco. XXXXXXX and Day play off each other beautifully in that scene. But XXXXX especially as she registers about four different emotions at once. <br /><br />Day and XXXXXXX are on vacation with their son XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXX in Morocco and they make the acquaintance of XXXXXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXX and the aforementioned English couple, XXXXXXX XXXXX and XXXXXX XXXXXXXX. Gelin is stabbed in the back at a market place in Marrakesh and whispers some dying words to XXXXXXX about an assassination to take place in XXXXXX XXXX in London. Their child is snatched in order to insure their silence.<br /><br />For the only time I can think of a hit song came out of a XXXXXXXXX film. XXXXX in fact plays a noted singer who retired from the stage to be wife and mother. The song was XXX XXXX XXXX and I remember it well at the age of 9. You couldn't go anywhere without hearing it in 1956, it even competed with the fast rising XXXXX XXXXXXX that year. XXX XXXX XXXX won the Academy Award for XXXX XXXX beating out such titles as XXXX XXXX from High Society and the title song from Around the World in 80 Days. It became XXXXX Day's theme song for the rest of her life and still is should she ever want to come back.<br /><br />In fact the song is worked quite nicely into the plot as XXXXX sings it at an embassy party at the climax.<br /><br />Instead of doing it with mirrors, XXXXXXXXX shot the assassination scene at the real XXXXXX XXXX and like another reviewer said it's not directed, it's choreographed. You'll be hanging on your seats during that moment.<br /><br />This was remake well worth doing.
