I just want to say that XXXXX Diamantopoulos's role as Williams for that entire show, was Emmy worthy. It was uncanny how well he did. And to be as rapid-fire and as random and as creative as XXXXX Williams really is....WOW. There were scenes where XXXXXXXXXXXXXX had to say probably 20 rapid fire lines and do 15 different characters while delivering those lines, all while sounds as much like ROBIN WILLIAMS doing those characters.....well, that my friends is impressive acting. Its one thing to do a XXXXX Williams impersonation for a couple of minutes. Its another to do it for a whole TV movie.<br /><br />I don't know how I felt about the whole show, and I don't know how much they played with the facts, but I do know that it was XXXXX Diamantopoulos that kept me watching. So for that, I give HIM a 10.
