And a perfect film to watch during the holiday season as the winter/Xmas atmosphere that XXXXXX creates for XXXXXX XXXX is way cool. It's weird that XXXXXX decided to release this as a summer film. It doesn't fit.<br /><br />But what's even weirder, when you consider the content of this film, is that it was aimed at families. An upper-class family throws their mutant baby down the sewer, a socio phobic billionaire dresses up in leather as a flying rodent, a lonely secretary dresses up in leather as a feline and a freak runs for political office. And S&M and bondage are presented in a very perverted way. But XXXXXX got away with it. His visual style in this film is at it's best.<br /><br />This and XXXXXX: Dead End are the only true live-action incarnations of the comic-book character. True, the animated series was the closest to the source material, but compared with XXXXXX Forever and the un-nameable one after that, XXXXXX Returns is the best of the four.<br /><br />Darker and more violent than the first movie, the sense of Gothic pathos reaches a new high. I was quite keen on XXXXXXX XXXXXX as XXXXX XXXXX (don't even get me started on XXXXXX XXXXXXX!), he displayed the right balance of weirdo loner and cool crime fighter. XXXXXXXX Pfieffer is great as Catwoman (much sexier and more 'realisticly' cat-like), she wears that leather outfit better than XXXXX XXXXX. And XXXXX XXXXXX was so convincing as the Penguin that his scenes became disturbing to watch. And XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXX is brilliant as the spooky XXX XXXXXX (if you think you recognise Chip Shrek it's none other than a very young Leatherface/Butterfinger).<br /><br />XXXXX XXXXXX's score is also even better than it was first time round. His powerful and engaging themes are way better than the dross that followed in the later 2 Schumacher movies. This movie is the XXXXXX phenomenon at its Zenith. Forget the following sequels and stick to the animated series after this. Let's hope that XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXX and XXXXXXXXX XXXX can bring some integrity back to the live action XXXXXX with their movie next year.<br /><br />This DVD was one of the first ever DVDs released by XXXXXX (almost 7 years ago!!!) and as a result there are NO features and the case is a snapper. Pick it up cheap like I did and hope for an SE in the future.
