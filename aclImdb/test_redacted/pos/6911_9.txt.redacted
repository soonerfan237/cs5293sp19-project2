Before I watched this tv movie I did not know much about one of my favorite actresses. After watching it, I realized how sad XXXXXXX XXXX's life really was. It had it's great moments too, but I didn't realize how sad it was. This movie was very good and told the story of the beloved XXXXXXX XXXX very well. I highly reccommend it.
