You don't see the meaning of the title till much later, but you get the point of it in the first few minutes. This directorial debut from Golden Globe nominated (for actor) XXXXX DeVito, also playing Owen/Ned 'Little Ned' Lift, is a terrific Hitchcock-like film about one man's hate for his wife's book (she stole his), and one man's hate for his mother. Basically, XXXX wants to be a good writer, like his teacher Larry Donner (Billy Crystal), and he inspired by murder stories. XXXXX suggests he see a Hitchcock film, quite ironic, and that is when Owen has the idea to kill XXXXX's ex-wife, Margaret (Star Trek Voyager's Kate Mulgrew). Owen is inspired by 'Strangers on a Train', swapping murders, so XXXXX must kill Owen's horrible Momma (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Anne Ramsey). XXXXX was convinced Owen killed Margaret, and also that he had to/wanted to kill Owen's Momma, but there is a happy ending when months later both XXXXX and Owen bring out books, Momma died naturally, and they went on a holiday with Beth Ryan (Kim Greist). Also starring XXX Reiner as Joel and Oprah Winfrey. With hilarious moments, a great director/actor and his support, this is a must-see comedy. Very, very good!
