I would have to say that in general Barbie Movies have impressed me. I have a 5 year old XXXXXX fanatic niece and she watches them all the time so needless to say I have seen quite a lot of XXXXXX these holidays, but I am not sick of them.<br /><br />This film, visually, has a lot to offer, especially the backgrounds, and the animation of the characters has improved with each new movie. One thing I noticed in particular was a vast improvement in the animation of XXXXXX's hair in this film. It has a lovely range of excerpts from classical music and I think that this is great, as it exposes a new generation to the classics. This film is well worth ago, especially if you have young relievers. They will be entertained for hours!
