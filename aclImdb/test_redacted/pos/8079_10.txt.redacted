In the year 2000 (keep in mind, this is two years ago, not four), two men had the motivation to create the most miraculous piece of art on this side of the Mississippi.<br /><br />Thanks to XXXX XXXXXXXXXX and XXX XXXXX, the world can now enjoy Second String, a delicious TV movie depicting a tale of a rag-tag gang of second stringers (thus the title) who are thrust into the position of starters due to an order of bad oysters.<br /><br />Because of the motivational direction of both the director XXXXXX XXXXXXXXX and the Buffalo XXXXX' last minute QB, XXX "Give 'em hell" Heller (portrayed by Canadian actor, XXX XXXXXXX) the oft XXXXX XXXX snake-bitten XXXXX find themselves in the ultimate position.<br /><br />With an intriguing mix of internal and external conflict, a love story, comraderie that only the fine sport of football can bring, and an overall theory that the underdog can compete, Second String is an excellent movie worthy of viewing every possible moment that it appears on TNT.<br /><br />The only thing potentially bad about this production is the spelling of the Costume Designer's first name, XXXXXXX Jarvis.<br /><br />
