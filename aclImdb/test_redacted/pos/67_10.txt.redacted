This XXXXX Edwards film isn't too sure whether it wants to be a comedy, a drama or a musical. No matter, the sheer presence of XXXXX Andrews, is reason enough to see this comedy-drama-musical-spy spoof. Julie is beautiful and uses her many talents, throughout the film. XXXX Hudson looks tired, but he's is more than fine, as Julie's romantic interest. Authentic World War I cars and planes, add to the appeal. Overall, the film is very entertaining. The DVD release is an edited (by XXXXX Edwards) version of the original release. Supposedly, this is the only version that XXXXXXX would allow; but, Turner Classic Movies has shown the complete (theatrical release) version, recently. Recommended.
