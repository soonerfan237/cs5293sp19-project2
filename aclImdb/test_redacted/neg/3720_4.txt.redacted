Meek and mild XXXXXX G. Robinson (as Wilbert Winkle) decides to quit his bank job and do what he wants, open a "fix-it" repair shop behind his house. XXX Robinson is married, but childless; he has befriended local orphanage resident Ted Donaldson (as Barry). XXXXX Donaldson is an eager workshop assistant, and sees Robinson as a father figure. XXXXXXXX's nagging wife Ruth Warwick (as Amy) is unhappy with XXXXXXXX's job choice, and conspires to return matters to her idea of normalcy. Their lives are further disrupted when XXXXXXXX is drafted.<br /><br />The war also disrupts what might have been an interesting story, as XXXXXXXX's character struggles against a domineering, unsympathetic wife. Possibly, filmmakers are showing how war can save marriages and positively redirect lives. XXXXXXXX and Donaldson are a likable team. XXXXXX Mitchum has an inauspicious bit part. The ending "trick" played by Ms. Warwick and XXXXXXXXX is predictably staged.
