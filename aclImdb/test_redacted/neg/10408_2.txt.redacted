whomever thought of having sequels to XXXX Eagle must be shot. In this case once was enough. XXXX Eagle was a good movie to watch. Even though it is unrealistic, it is still entertaining. XXXX Eagle II has a senseless plot and can be used to as a cure to insomnia. I didn't even bother to watch XXXX Eagle III, but from looking at the R rating, I assume it's more violent than the past 2 movies. Well, XXXX Eagle IV is probably the most inane sequel. XXX Gossett Jr. returns as the always delightful "Chappy" Sinclair. Another XXXXX returns to fill the role of Doug Masters (Canadian XXXXX Cadieux, who looks just like XXXXX Gedrick from the first Iron Eagle). But wait(Here comes a possible spoiler).....Wasn't XXXX killed in Iron Eagle II? The writers must've been desprate for a story so they revived XXXX Masters by saying he was a prisoner of the Russians. This movie was the cheapest done of all the Iron Eagle films. Why do movie makers find it neccessary to make sequels to unappealing movies? (ex. Police Academy movies). I have always liked XXXXXXX Jr.'s work in these films. He was the only one holding this turkey together. Let's hope this was the last of the Iron Eagle sequels. let it rest in peace.
