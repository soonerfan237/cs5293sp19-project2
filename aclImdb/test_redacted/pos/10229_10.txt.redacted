As an avid reader of XXXXX XXXXXX, I truly anticipated this film prior to it's release... I was not let down. "Nightbreed" is a horse of a different color. XXXX in the underlying decay of western civilization and dripping with alternative existence in a way we have never seen before. Barker is at his best when he allows us to peek into his world of unprecedented horror, yet showing us the other side of the coin. Here the "Monsters" are the hideously beautiful beings, while the humans are the deceptively ugly creatures of self indulgence. We soon learn that we were wrong all along. By far my favorite performance by the often under-used XXXXX XXXXXXX, and the added bonus of XXXXX XXXXXXXXXX as "Decker" is a cast best seen then believed. The "Monsters" are portrayed flawlessly by a bevy of English creature masters, whom many also brought the "Cenobites" to life in "Hellraiser", including "Pinhead" himself XXXX XXXXXXX. "Nightbreed" is an absolute must see for any fan of the horror genre, and anyone who needs just a little (Something) more out of their horror story. This IS XXXXX XXXXXX at his finest.
