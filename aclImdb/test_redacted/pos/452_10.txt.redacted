"The Journey" is a very good film. Produced in the spring of 1958, in Vienna, and released in 1959, this movie was quite popular in his early years. Despite the political problems, which influenced the movie's success (because the story happens during the Hungarian Revolution, the Cold War), "The Journey" is a very good film, but not well-known. I think it should be released immediately on DVD, because most of the people who have seen it so far want to have it at home. One of the most important qualities of the film is the extraordinary chemistry between XXXXXXX XXXX and XXX XXXXXXX, their intense relationship. All their scenes together are very important, but they also reveal the strong feelings, the great passion and love between the characters (XXXXX XXXXX and XXXXX XXXXXXX). Another quality is the script, which is very well written. It was even published as a novel, by the screen player XXXXXX XXXXXX. The film keeps its tension from the beginning to the end. At first, we didn't know if XXXXX and the other travelers could leave Hungary, because the Communist XXXXX discovers that XXXXX's friend, XXXX XXXXX, is Hungarian and he isn't allowed to leave the country. The XXXXX falls deeply in love with XXXXX and this is, in fact, the true reason why he doesn't want to let her go. But after he embraces her and gives her one of the most memorable kisses ever seen on screen, and she kisses him, too, he lets her go. And the end of the film is one of the most dramatic endings ever filmed-the XXXXX and XXXXX say "Goodbye!", she arrives at the frontier with all the travelers, including XXXX, while XXXXX is shot several times by some Hungarians, so he dies. XXX XXXXXXX is very, very handsome and XXXXXXX XXXX is very beautiful, charming, refined, just like an English Lady. XXX and XXXXXXX are perfect together. They are one of the greatest couples of the Golden Hollywood. A true moviegoer should watch this film. "The Journey" has everything that a good film should have-a great, captivating story, interesting characters, a wonderful direction (XXXXXXX XXXXXX is, in my opinion, at his best). Finally, I want to give a message to XXXXXX XXXXX XXXXXXX or those who restore and release classic films: Please, release "The Journey" on DVD as soon as possible.
