Enjoyable film that gives you romance, women-on-the-verge psychodrama, work place sexual harassment, adultery, and fashion. It's all there. Typical characters found in corporate America. XXXX Crawford is the usual long time employee bitch executive who feels the need to be such because she's with the big boys. XXXX XXXXX is the entry level ambitious employee whose determined to get to the top by using her mind and not her body. Their personal lives is the subplot. <br /><br />Wardrobe for the film is great but someone forgot to tell XXXXXXX XXXX's hairstylist that "a little dab will do ya!" The amount of Brylcream in XXXXXXX XXXX's hair is distracting at times. His character's relationship with XXXXX's character was never fully developed which I found disappointing. Overall the movie is enjoyable. <br /><br />Rating: 8/10
