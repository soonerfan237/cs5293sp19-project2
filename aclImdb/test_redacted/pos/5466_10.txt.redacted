Excellent story with supperb acting by all of the cast. The warmth and insight into who XXXX represents moved off of the screen and into the heart of this viewer. The frustration's and tenacity of XXXXXX Madalyn in her quest to do HIS work till her last breath was also done with excellance by Barbara Hershey. The intertwining of the personalities of Joad and XXXXXX Madalyn grew throughout the story line with a breath taking crescendo in the final scene.
