I loved this film because of the dialog and superb acting by XXXXXXX and Jacqueline. However, I never knew until now, watching a XXXXX David marathon on TNT that this film is a remake of a 1943 XXXXX Davis classic called Old Acquaintance. Bette co-stars with XXXXXX Hopkins who she was in a terrible feud with during the making of the movie because Bette had had an affair with XXXXXX's husband who directed her in a film before they made Old Acquaintance.<br /><br />Anyway, both are worth every minute spent watching. I highly recommend this film if you like a lot of dialog and drama. It's a study in the psychology of women and their relationships with each other, in my opinion.
