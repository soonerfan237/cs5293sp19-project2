Fans of Euro-horror flicks - Portland's video/DVD store XXXXX XXXXXXX has a whole section devoted to this genre - can't afford to miss XXXXXX XXXXXXX's gut-busting "L'isola degli uomini pesce" (called "Screamers" in the United States). Here's the lowdown: some shipwreck survivors land on an uncharted Caribbean island in 1891. The island is inhabited by a landowner, a scientist (XXXXXX XXXXXX) and his daughter (XXXXXXX XXXX). Sure enough, it turns out that the landowner is making the scientist create a race of fish-men. And while the fish-men remain calm as long as they can drink their potion, they get nasty otherwise.<br /><br />This movie is sort of a mixture of genres: Euro-horror, swashbuckling, voodoo, and maybe a little bit of "The Island of Dr. Moreau". But it's mostly an excuse to have the fish-men disembowel trespassers; ya gotta love that! I wouldn't be surprised if the Euro-horror genre gave XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX some of his ideas for "Grindhouse". After all, the European horror directors have no scruples about what they show. This is one that you're sure to like.<br /><br />So XXXXXX XXXXXX is the only cast member from an XXXXXX XXXXXXXXX movie (I mean "Shadow of a Doubt") who later co-starred with XXXXX XXXXX's soon-to-be wife and XXXXXX XXXXXXX's ex (by whom I mean XXX XXXXXX) in an Italian horror flick. The things that we see in life...
