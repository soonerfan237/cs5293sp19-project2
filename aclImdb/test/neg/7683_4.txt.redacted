Well, "built" XXXXX Day (as XXXXX XX "Dynamite" XXXXXXX) is mistaken for thespian XXXXX XXXXXXXXX, and falls in love with dancer XXX XXXXXX (as S. "Sam" Winthrop Putnam). Older XXXXXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXXX (as XXXXXXXX XXXXXXX) also digs XXXXX. HonestlyÂ… What were they thinking? - This wildly inappropriate musical does feature Ms. Day prettily singing the standard "April in Paris", and others. Certainly, there nothing as good as her Columbia recordings from the time; and, nothing approaches Day's stunning and forthcoming "Secret Love". Although the material does not serve him well, it's nice to see XXX XXXXXX performing. Some of the musical numbers are obnoxious.<br /><br />**** April in Paris (12/24/52) XXXXX XXXXXX ~ XXXXX Day, XXX XXXXXX, XXXXXX XXXXXXX
