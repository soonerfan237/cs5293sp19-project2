There's no better way to describe the HORRENDOUS experience that's to watch XXXXX Mia: Hitler must be looking up, saying to the pseudo-director Phyllida Lloyd 'You monster, what have you done?'<br /><br />Everything about the movie is wrong. JustÂ… Wrong! Even its success, which is unexplainable. I can understand when those crappy parody movies, like XXXX Movie, make their minimal share of money and turn profit just because they're cheap (of course they are!). But when something like XXXXX Mia makes 450 million dollars worldwide, you think 'what the hell is wrong with the world?'<br /><br />And to think we have XXXXX Streep, one of the greatest alive actresses of the world, in it? What was she thinking? 'I need the money', she could say. Well then, sell one of your grandchildren, even that would be less embarrassing. It's not that XXXXX is good in a disastrous piece of, err, 'movie'. She's also disastrous! When she sings, even though she's got the vocals, it's ridiculous. Worse than her only XXXXXX Brosnan. He used to be XXXXX Bond. Now he's singing XXXX in a purple spandex during the credits of the worst movie ever. Really? And when I mention XXXX, not that I have anything against the band and their music. Though it doesn't help them when actors started singing (badly), dancing (worse) and the extras join then (They pop out of nowhere! Frequently!) to present one terrible musical sequences after the other. You wanna cry when the music starts. And I love musicals! But this is the first in the genre where you PRAY for actual silence.<br /><br />I could keep going. The list goes on forever. You could write a XXXXXXX King novel with the complete list of mistakes in this movie.<br /><br />To sum up: go watch it! Really! You've got to witness to understand!! And since it's already a huge success, who cares if it makes a few more dollars from you? And it's not liking you're selling your soul to the devil. XXXXX did that before. For the whole mankind. And now the world must end, because we've committed the ultimate evil and we must be destroyed.
