The Andrew Davies adaptation of the XXXXX XXXXXX' novel was excellent. The characters of XXX and and XXXXX were superbly portrayed by XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX and XXXXXX XXXXX respectively. The whole series was a total joy to watch. It caught the imagination of everyone across the board, whether straight or gay. I wish there could be a sequel!
