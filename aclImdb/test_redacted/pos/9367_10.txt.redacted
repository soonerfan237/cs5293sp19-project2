The real Best Picture of 1947 also deals with Anti-Semitism and is superior to XXXX XXXXX's GENTLEMEN'S AGREEMENT (the eventual winner at that year's XXXXXXX XXXXXX) in practically every department. XXXXXX XXXXXXX's near-perfect direction, XXXX XXXXXX's terse script and J. Roy XXXX's expert Expressionist lighting are wonderfully abetted by a superb ensemble cast. Although XXXXXX XXXXX (playing an easy-going, methodical and very likable cop) and XXXXXX XXXXXXX (who actually does have the occasional throwaway witty remark) are the nominal stars of the film, it's Oscar nominees XXXXXX XXXX and XXXXXX XXXXXXX - as well as XXXX XXXXX, in the small but pivotal role of Grahame's pathetic husband - who give the film's most memorable characterizations; XXXX proved so convincing as a homicidal racist that he was eventually typecast for a while, excelling in equally villainous roles in such films as ACT OF VIOLENCE (1948), CAUGHT (1948), THE RACKET (1951), CLASH BY NIGHT (1952), THE NAKED SPUR (1953) and BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK (1955). The film is also notable for its atypical structure in that XXXX's "flashback" sequence, a complete fabrication, is shot in a straightforward manner while the actual truth emerges from the hazy, distorted recollections of the real protagonist of the film who, furthermore, isn't even played by any of the film's stars! Also, CROSSFIRE was originally to have treated homosexuality (as per XXXXXXX XXXXXX' original source novel, "The Brick Foxhole") but this taboo subject was unacceptable to the Hays Office at the time - a far cry from the situation we have today when (at least) 3 gay-themed films are in the running for this years' major Oscars!<br /><br />The print utilized for Warners' DVD transfer shows some regrettable signs of wear-and-tear at times but the Audio Commentary by noir experts, XXXXX XXXXXX and XXXXX XXXXXX, is a good one, even though I don't happen to share their opinion that XXXXXXX's career declined steadily after his HUAC troubles, as such excellent pictures as THE SNIPER (1952), THE CAINE MUTINY (1954), BROKEN LANCE (1954), THE YOUNG LIONS (1958), WARLOCK (1959) and MIRAGE (1965) amply prove; having said that his collaborations at RKO with producer XXXXXX XXXXX and screenwriter XXXX XXXXXX - MURDER, MY SWEET (1944), CORNERED (1945; hopefully this will be part of the next XXXX XXXX XXX XXX from Warners) and CROSSFIRE - do constitute his best work. In any case, in my opinion, the latter is not only one of the key films of the 1940s but also one of the finest noirs ever made, period.
