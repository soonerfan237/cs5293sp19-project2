This movie is ageless and would probably appeal to children today, even if there isn't a Jedi in the entire thing. Of course, XXXXXXXXX Taylor was the most beautiful child in the world and her acting is great too. Even XXXXXX Rooney is good; so are Anne Revere and Angela Lansbury. The world was a different place when this movie was released, and it certainly is a great place to visit.
