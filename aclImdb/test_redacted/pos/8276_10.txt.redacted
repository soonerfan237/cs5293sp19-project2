I was -Unlike most of the reviewers- not born in the 80's. I was born on may 14th 1994. Despite this, my life was very much in the style of the 80's. When other kids had playstations, I was playing XXXXX on my NES etc. Now, this movie holds a special place in my heart already despite me being only 15 years old at the time of writing this review. I, because of my 80's style early Childhood, watched many TV shows and saw Many movies that other kids didn't see, and this movie was one of those, and one of the greatest too.<br /><br />It starts off in the Los Angeles home of XXXXX XXXXXXX, XXXXX XXXXXXX, Theodore Seville and XXXXX XXXXXXX. XXXXX, the Chipmunk's adoptive father, is in a rush to get to the airport as he is going on a business trip around Europe. His taxi is almost there and The Chipmunks help him pack. While they are talking, XXXXX expresses his will to come with XXXX and to see the world (Even though, technically XXXX is only going to Europe, so to XXXXX, apparently only America and Europe qualify as ''The World''). XXXXX is leaving the Chipmunks in the care of XXXX XXXXXX, much to the displeasure of the boys. Soon XXXX is off to the airport and the Chipmunks are left at home with XXXX XXXXXX. Later, at a local Caf√© the Chipmunks are playing a game of ''Around the World in 30 days'' against the Chipettes(Brittany, XXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXe). After losing the game to Brittany after having his Hot air XXXXXXX eaten out of the sky by a crocodile, XXXXX get's in an argument with Brittany about who would really win a race around the world. Two diamond smugglers sitting at a nearby table, XXXXX and XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX overhear their argument and, needing a safe way of transporting their diamonds over the world, decide to fool the children into delivering them for them. They set up a race around the world, where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness (Secretely filled with diamonds) at drop offs around the world and receive a doll in the opposing team's likeness (secretely filled with the payment for the diamonds) to ''varify that they were there''. The winning team would then receive a 100.000 dollar reward. They do this because they believe that Jamal (An Interpol agent who has been hot on their heels for some times now) would never suspect them because they are just kids (However, this seems to be redundant, because on their travels, the kids do not have to go through any security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls, I suspect that neither would XXXXX or Claudia if they had taken the diamonds there personally.) And so begins a great adventure. This film is a classic and I see no reason why anyone would not like it. It features great animation and top-notch voice acting, not to mention the Kick-ass music (Pardon my french :P). My favorite song is without a shred of doubt ''The Girls and Boys of Rock and Roll'' An amazing rock song that cannot be topped. It's also my favorite moment in the film. Other notable songs include ''Getting XXXXX''(Kind of Suggestive for a kid's film eh?) and ''My Mother'' as well as ''XXXXX XXXXX'' and ''Off to see the world'' Not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the Royal London Philharmonic Orchestra. The scene with ''My mother'' still brings a tear to my eye. In relation to the song ''Getting XXXXX'' I first didn't think anything of it, but when I grew older and learned about life, it became clear that that song was a little bit suggestive. That song, along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the Chipettes panties. This is especially apparent in the scene in Egypt when the Chipettes are being chased by the XXXXXXX XXXXXX's men, when XXXXXXX leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely. While this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film, it's one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are 4-feet tall Chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly high-pitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child. Anyway, A bit after that scene, the Chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the Chipmunks and get home. The Direction of Janice Karman perfects this movie as she and her husband, XXXX XXXXXXXXXXX Jr. know the characters better than anyone. They even do the voices of the Chipmunks and the Chipettes. XXXX doing the voices for XXXXX and Simon (as well as XXXX) and Janice doing the voices for All the Chipettes and Theodore. Speaking of male characters that are voiced by female voice actresses, XXXXX XXXXXXXXXX (The voice of XXXX XXXXXXX) makes an appearance in this movie. She plays the part of the XXXXXXX XXXXXX, a very small, but important role. The ending is of course, a happy one. The Crooks have been caught, the loose ends tied and The film ends when the Children, XXXX and XXXX XXXXXX are driving into the sunset, XXXXX complaining about not having gotten his 100.000 dollar reward for winning the race, which annoys XXXX until he finally yells ''ALVIN!'' and the screen fades to black<br /><br />Classic ending, by the way. I hope you found my review of this movie useful, and if you haven't seen this flick, give it a watch, It's worth the money. This Nostalgic classic from the 80's gets a solid 10 out of 10. <br /><br />''Headin' for the top, Don't you know! we never stop believing now''
