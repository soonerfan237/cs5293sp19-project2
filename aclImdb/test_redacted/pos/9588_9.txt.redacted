Tweety is sent in his cage on a train by his old-lady owner. In the same baggage car, also in a cage, is XXXXXXXXX. <br /><br />In no time, XXXXXXXXX has grabbed Tweety but a trainman comes back and slaps the "sneakin' feline," as he calls him, back in his cage. He puts XXXXXX "in a safer place," up high and tells the cat, "Now, remember: no tricks!" XXXXXXXXX puts his halo on and looks innocent. Yeah, right.<br /><br />I found the funniest stuff, however, didn't involve XXXXXXXXX versus Tweety but the "viscious dog" that is in another cage next to XXXXXXXXX. The cat gets mouthy with him, and pays a big price in an extremely funny manner. Sylvester just doesn't learn, but that's one reason we love him! (I know a number of IMDb reviewers don't like XXXXXX but I like both main characters - they both crack me up!)<br /><br />Also, the train, and the passing scenery, is beautifully illustrated in here - really nice visuals.
