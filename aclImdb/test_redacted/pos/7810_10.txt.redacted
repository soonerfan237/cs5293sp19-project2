There have been very few great comedy films in the history of XXXXX Cinema. XXXXX Apna Apna happens to be one of them. The film is based on a very simple story of two poor young men (XXXXX and Salman) who dream of becoming rich by marrying a millionaire's daughter (Raveena). XXXXX and Salman Khan try their best to outwit each other and woo Raveena. The plot thickens when XXXXXX Rawal & Co. plan to take over all the wealth. The movie is well paced and very funny. Rarely does one come across a Hindi comedy which is both funny and intelligent. This is one of the few films with XXXXX and Salman together (probably the only film!). Unfortunately it did not succeed at the box-office, and we might never see a film of this calibre again. XXXXX Khan is brilliant in the film and has proved his versatility as an actor in this film. XXXXXX Khan gives a very good performance as a dim-wit. Raveena plays a convincing role as a confused rich girl, and XXXXXXXX who is Raveena's assistant/friend is also funny. XXXXXX Rawal, Junior Ajith, Shakti Kapoor, Deven Verma, Jagdeep and Tiku Talsania just add to the flavour of the film! All in all, the best Hindi comedy ever made and I wish they make more quality films like this one. You will want to watch this film time and again.<br /><br />P.S - For those of you who have watched this film, I also suggest Gol Maal, XXXXXX XXXXXX, Chhoti Si Baat, Naram Garam, Hera Pheri (old and new), etc.
