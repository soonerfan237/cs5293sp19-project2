*minor spoilers*<br /><br />You know, it's getting to the point where XXXX Disney Television Animation might just as well be called XXXX Disney Sequel Animation. These sequels range from excellent ("Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas" and the fantastic "Lion King II: XXXXX's Pride") to horrible ("The Return of Jafar"). (This is, of course, my personal opinion.) Now Disney brings us their latest sequel. "XXXXX's adventure," and while it is flawed, it is still entertaining.<br /><br />The quality of animation is not up to par with Disney Feature Animation; still, the animators do a good job of bringing the characters to life. Lady and Tramp have not aged a day since 1955. Trusty still talks about his sense of smell and "Ol' Reliable," and XXXX still gives him grief about it. There's a nice fight between XXXXX and a huge dog in the dog pound, and once again we are treated to a spaghetti dinner with the two romantic leads (though it is highly doubtful that this will become a classic scene like its predecessor.)<br /><br />I really don't care for most of the songs (though XXXXX Bart and Susan Egan--the singing voices of Scamp and Angel--sing their parts very nicely). Both XXXXXXX Manchester and Norman Gimbel have done much better work in the past. XXXXX Troob's score is okay, but nothing memorable. And some of the junkyard gang seem like excess baggage; that is, they really don't do much.<br /><br />The voice work, on the other hand, is quite good. While I don't like XXXX Bennett as the dogcatcher, he is very good as Tramp. XXXXX Palminteri does a nice job as Buster, leader of the junkyard gang, and Alyssa Milano gives what may be her best performance as Angel. Then there is Scamp (who is the spitting image of his dad). He is voiced to PERFECTION by XXXXX Wolf. Wolf does a superb job of showing XXXXX's wild streak and his soft side.<br /><br />All in all, while "XXXXX's Adventure" is flawed, it still makes for rather entertaining viewing. It is my hope, however, that XXXX Disney Television Animation will turn their attention to more original material for their future releases.<br /><br />
