Wretched. Talk about botched. BEYOND THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE is bad in every respect. Salvagers XXXXXXX Caine and Karl Malden decide to tow the wreck of the eponymous ocean liner with a really creaky tug boat. They're challenged by ruthless XXXXX Savalas and his gang of machine-gun toting goons. This part sequel, part remake has XXXXX, Malden and ANOTHER group of Poseidon survivors making a similarly dangerous trek out of the sinking ship. Among this group are XXXXXXX Jones, Slim Pickens, Peter Boyle, XXXXXXX Knight and Slim Pickens. XXXX Warden plays a blind man. Surely, you'll wish you were blind after seeing this mess. Sally XXXXX is particularly annoying as a stowaway on board Caine's tug.<br /><br />Disaster master Irwin Allen not only produced this one, he decided to direct it as well.
