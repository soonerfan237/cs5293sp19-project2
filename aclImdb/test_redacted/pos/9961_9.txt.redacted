The Merchant of Venice is a fantastic movie. It's very true to the original XXXXXXXXXXX play. If you saw XXXXXX XXXXX in Casanova and liked his performance, this is a movie for you! If you saw XXXXXX XXXXXXX in XXXXXXXXXXX in Love and you enjoyed his performance, this is a movie for you! If you saw XX XXXXXX in Donnie Brasco and liked his performance, this is a movie for you! It is a very enjoyable movie and if you're studying XXXXXXXXXXX like me, this is a great movie to see!! The only problem with this movie is that you can't let the little ones see it because is has a wee bit of nudity in it. But other than that, it's a really good movie!!
