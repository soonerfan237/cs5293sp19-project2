Hey; Belmondo! Look there's XXXX Karina! Great American improvised New Wave (or Independent you want to call it that), not as good as XXXXXX or Truffaut, and not flawless, but hey such realism, style, warmth and humor. I love that NY accent; "you don't know nothing!"; "forget about it". Just like the French New Wave, it's about young people; partying, falling in love or just hanging around. XXXXX Goldoni is so cute; she's adorable; wonderful. XXX Carruthers' also good, reminds me of Belmondo. A film you won't forget.<br /><br />A steady 26.5 out of 31 ;-)
