After Mrs and XXX XXXX this is yet another very good film by XXXXXX sen(mostly in English). In the earlier film she treated a contemporary political environment and its effect on individuals. In this film it is the impact of mentally disabled member of the family and its impact on the family. As a parallel sub theme she treats a philosophical concept on "reality". It is a film which leads to thinking after seeing the film.<br /><br />XXXXXX the younger sister (XXXXXXX XXX XXXXXX, the daughter of XXXXXX Sen) is suffering from Schizophrenia being taken care of by the dominant elder sister XXXXXX (XXXXXXX XXXX) . XXXXXX after her marriage with XXXX and separation from him believes that she is still with JOJO and her five children in 15 Park avenue in Kolkotta.(there is no such address in Kolkotta-it seems there is one in New York) and she is intense in her belief. It is almost like an intense religious belief. Ultimately what is reality? In one scene she tells XXXXXX "if I tell you that you are not a professor but only imagine that you are a professor". The open ending reflects this reality. In a supposedly search for her home in park avenue, XXXXXX is lost. The penultimate scene is XXXXXX looking at a group of five children playing and her looking at them with joy of returning to her family and then she is lost. About this concept of reality I am reminded of another film of fifties called HARRY with XXXXX XXXXXXX. The protagonist believes that a big sized rabbit (?), called XXXXX is always with him and he is always conversing with him. At the end even the doctor believes perhaps there is XXXXX. What is reality, is it what the protagonist believes or what other believe XXXXXXX XXXX dominates the film with her sterling performance as the strong elder sister with undercurrent of frustration. XXXXXXX XXX XXXXXX gives equally befitting performance as the schizophrenic.<br /><br />Yet the film is not as tight as Mrs and XXX XXXX. There appear to be some loose ends. And perhaps there are too many characters. Those who want a closed ending may not appreciate the open ending here. But the ending befits the theme of the film.<br /><br />Yet another good film by XXXXXXX sen.
