I sat through all 2 hours. I do not know what was worse, the awful plot, the lame characters or the hawaiian hottie that XXXXX's 11 yearold kid and 80 year old grandpa made sexual advances toward. The money spent on this was just flushed down the throne. XXXXX Simmons should be ashamed. The original idea for this movie was "A XXXXX Family Griswold" and it somehow turned into this mess. The only bright spot is that it's ratings were so bad we will never see this on TV again. AVOID AT ALL COSTS...RENT ERNEST SAVES XMAS or something else.
