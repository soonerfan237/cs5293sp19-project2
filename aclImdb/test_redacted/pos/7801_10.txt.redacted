XXXXX Apna Apna is a movie that I treasure and its one movie, I don't mind seeing at any time... well almost any time! This movie is simply marvelous and according to me, is the funniest movie I've ever seen! And yes, I do put it over XXXX Pheri... reason? XXXX Pheri has scenes you'll watch out but Andaz Apna Apna? Not possible! Simply because every scene is a scene you got to watch out for! XXXXX & Salman share great chemistry and are perfect in their shoes but I'll put the characters in order of favoritism: <br /><br />Rank # 1. Crime XXXXXX Gogo (Shakti Kapoor's best performance till date and yes, this happened before the casting couch): Gogo is an innocent character who belongs to well reputed family of Mogambo (Mr. India fame). Crime XXXXXX Gogo is actually Mogambo's nephew but for Mogambo, he's more than a responsible, handsome, charismatic charming son. Gogo, makes the biggest mistake of life by lending 36,000 rupees to Teja (who is as XXXXX had once said, "A Fraud and a Cheat!"). Now, XXXX's only goal is to get back what's his and in his journey of recovering his lost money, XXXX realizes that there is more than 36,000 that he needs to achieve and thus begins... XXXX's struggle against the sinner-world.<br /><br />Rank # 2. Teja (Teja Main Hoon, XXXX Idhar Hai!): Teja is an evil character who is XXX Gopal Bajaj's twin. Originally named XXXXX Gopal Bajaj, Teja chooses to change his name to suit his personality. Teja, as a child had always envied his brother and then one day, things took a turn for the worse when his father gave his entire wealth to XXX Bajaj. XXXX decided to kill his father but in the night's darkness, instead killed Munshi Harish Chandra (Raveena's Dad), though XXXX doesn't regret his actions. Teja's sole mission, now, is to get back his property somehow and start his own Poultry & XXXXXX Farm. XXXX also needs to return back the loan to Gogo (but has no intentions whatsoever to do so). In order to achieve his evil goals, XXXX employs two people: Robert (Vijay Khote, who is very good at aiming) and Balla (Shahzad Khan, Ajit's clone and son... who is a very very smart boy!) <br /><br />Rank # 3. Amar (XXXXX Khan): Wants to marry the rich heiress Raveena, so he sells his father's cheap saloon and heads off for Mumbai. Amar, has no problem taking care of the big business that XXXXXXX's father will hand him over after their wedding and is willing to sacrifice his happiness and shift to London, if needed.<br /><br />Rank # 4. Prem (XXXXXX Khan): After Gogo, Prem is the second most innocent character to appear in the movie and the way Amar tries to take advantage of him in the mask of a friend, is tragic.<br /><br />I won't reveal any more characters because Jesus Christ! I just wouldn't stop typing! The movie is outright stunning! Go and get the DVD now and beware of those cheap VCDs as they have omitted many good scenes out of the movie.<br /><br />The background music is stud and the action is better than the Matrix, especially the final encountered between Prem and XXXXX Master Gogo (watch out for it), it appears in the climax. XXXXX Apna Apna is also a drama with many negative and positive characters and teach us a lot about life and values and ethics. It teaches us about bravery (why else would Amar ask XXXX to stay back when they go to meet the kidnapper, even though XXXX was complaining that he had to go to the toilet???). XXXXX Apna Apna is also a tragedy, especially the scenes where Salman is targeted by Aamir and is given overdose of stomach-upsetting pills, the part where Teja reveals his sad feelings regarding why he couldn't go to London and the part where Gogo is arrested in the ending, without even getting back his 36,000. XXXXX Apna Apna is overall a complete package.... sit back and enjoy the ride! Bet there'll be a second ride after that... and then a third!<br /><br />The movie was considered a flop back then and I bet no one liked it but buckle up guys! This movie is a big hit! Even if it didn't have enough people coming to theatres, the movie is one of the highest selling XXXX DVDs and one of the most frequently movie on most of the channels so the producers have laughed their way to the banks long time back!
