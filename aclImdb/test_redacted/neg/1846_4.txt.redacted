Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about XXXXXXX Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and XXXXXXXXX to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that XXXXXXX Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were XXXXX Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.
