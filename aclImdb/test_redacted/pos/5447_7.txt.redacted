Leno talks through his punch lines. This spoils the joke, for those of you who haven't figured it out. His show is held in a micro sized studio for a reason, or two reasons -- the small amount of laughter will be amplified, and few want to see him. XXXXXXXXX's set is the polar opposite -- Ed Sullivan would be proud and the balcony is always full.<br /><br />NBC, tacky NBC, will never get it. XXXXXXX David Sarnoff's megalomaniacal enterprise continues to be all about the money. At least CBS has a bit of a family feel to it.<br /><br />Leno collects cars, or is it stamps, while XXXXXXXXX races cars. The difference is informative.<br /><br />When I chatted I used to ask other chatters to email me if XXXX _ever_ said something that was funny. I never got a single email. XXXXXXXXX has superb timing. He also can re-use the most unfunny joke in such a way that it becomes one of the funniest things in that night's show.<br /><br />Letterman has built other careers. XXXX is now well known and respected in his own musical right. Even XXXX's other band members get recognition and career boosting. XXXX Henderson has become a name America knows of. Even the businesses in the same block as the Ed XXXXXXXX theater get a boost. What has Leno ever done for anyone else? Personally, I am glad that Dave moved and XXXX got the Carson gig. I never watched NBC shows before and had no reason to after.<br /><br />The Top Ten list is an American icon. So is XXXXXXXXX. Leno is a caricaturist's dream, nothing more.
