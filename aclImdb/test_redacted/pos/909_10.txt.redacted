Transcendental, sophisticated, incisive, emotive, powerful... I could think of a hundred adjectives to describe this fantastic work of art and intelligence, and still I would feel they were insufficient. All I can really say is that I am infatuated with this film. Applause to XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXXX XXXXX, and Jean-Louis Trintignant. May "Rouge" live forever.
