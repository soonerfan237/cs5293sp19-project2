Had the fun pleasure of viewing a new independent film called "XXXX XXXXX." I usually go out to the local cinema with my husband and feel as if we are held captive to the latest XXXXXX, or Prequel that XXXXXXXXX throws at us. This was DIFFERENT and surprisingly  SO MUCH more entertaining than anything XXXXXXXXX spends millions advertising. When my husband and I go the movies, we go to be entertained  and "XXXX XXXXX" did just that and the film did so in a smart manner that made me feel as if my trip to the movie theater was worth it. It is a funny, human, and surprising sometimes musical story that cleverly entertains in its simplicity. I especially enjoyed the scene with the 4 men singing in harmony in the bathroom. It is almost like an operetta. That particular scene reminded me of a scene in "Phantom of the Opera" when 4 of the performers did not just, i.e., they sang against one another in a friendly retort. I am not a film maven but this film was more enjoyable than any other major studio film I have seen lately. It is silly, funny, entertaining and amusing. Completely enjoyable  which is what I expect from movies but rarely do they deliver like "XXXX XXXXX."
