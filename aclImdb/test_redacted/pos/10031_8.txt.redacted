BEING XXXXXX Brothers' second historical drama featuring XXXXX XXX and Battle of the Little Big Horn, General XXXXXX XXXXXXXXX XXXXXX, THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON (XXXXXX Brothers, 1941) was the far more accurate of the two; especially when contrasted with SANTA FE TRAIL (XXXXXX Brothers, 1940), which really didn't set the bar very high.<br /><br />ALTHOUGH both pictures were starring vehicles for XXXXX XXXXX, there was a change in the casting the part of General XXXXXX. Whereas it was "Dutch", himself, XXXXXX XXXXXX portraying the flamboyant, egomaniacal Cavalryman in the earlier picture, with XXX XXXXX playing Virginian and later Confederate Hero General, J.E.B. (or Jeb) Stuart; XXXXX took on the XXXXXX part for THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON.<br /><br />ONCE again, the XXXXXX Brothers' propensity for using a large number of reliable character actors from the "XXXXXX's Repertory Company" are employed in giving the film a sort of authenticity, and all is really happening right before our very own eyes. Major roles are taken by some better known actors and actresses, such as: XXXXXXXXX Bacon/Mrs. XXXXXX (co-star XXXXXX XX XXXXXXXXX), XXX XXXXXX (XXXXXX XXXXXXX), XXXXXX XXXXX (Gene Lockhart), Chief XXXXX XXXXX (XXXXXXX XXXXX), "Californy" (XXXXXXX XXXXXXX), XXXXX XXXXX (XXXXXXX XXXXXX), General Phillip Sheridan (XXXX XXXXX), Callie (the Bacon's Maid, XXXXXX XXXXXXXX). <br /><br />THE rest of the cast is just chock full of uncredited, though skilled players such as: XXX XXXXXX, XXXXXXX XXXXXX, XXXXX XXXXXX, XXX XXXXXXX, XXXXXX XXXXX, XXX XXXXXXXX, XXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXXXXX XXXX, XXXXXXX XXXXXXX, XXXXXX XXXXXXXX, Russell Hicks, XXXXXXX XXXXXX, XXXXXXX XXXXXX, XXXXX XXXXX, XXXX XXXXXX, XXX XXXXXXXX, XXXXXXX XXXXX, XXXXX XXXX, XXXXX XXXXXX, XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX, XXX XXXX, XXX XXXXXX (All-American, himself), XXXXXXX XXXXXX, XXXX XXXXXX, XXX XXXXX and many, many more.<br /><br />THE film moves very quickly, particularly in the early goings; then sort of slows down out of necessity as the story moves along to the Post XXXXX XXX years, the assignment of XXXXXX as a Colonel in the 7th Cavalry and the ultimate destiny at the Little Big Horn, in Montana. Under the guidance of Director, XXXXXXXX XXXXXXX, XXXXX XXXXX, the film hits a greatly varied array of emotions; from the very serious, exciting battle scenes and convincing historical scenes; looking as if they were XXXXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXX Photos. As with most any of XXX XXXXX's films, he punctuates and expedites the end of many a scene with a little humor; but not going overboard and thus risking the chance of turning the film into a comedy (farce, actually).<br /><br />AS previously mentioned, this is much more factual than its predecessor, SANTA FE TRAIL (last time we'll mention it, honest XXXXXXX, XXXXX's Honor!). However, that is not to say that it wasn't without a few little bits of "XXXXXXXX and Literary License; as indeed, just about any Biopic will have. It would be impossible to make any similar type of film if indeed every fact and incident were to be tried to be included in the screenplay. Perhaps the most erroneous inclusion as well as the most obvious invocation of Literary License is that business about XXXXXX's being accidentally promoted to the rank of Brigadier General. It just didn't happen that way, yet the "gag" both helped the film to move along; while it underscored the whole light, carefree feeling that permeated the early part of the film.<br /><br />DIRECTOR Walsh and XXX XXXXX collaborated in giving us what would seem to be a characterization of this legendary XXXXX XXX Hero that was very close to the real life man. And they did this on top of the recreation of an incident, being the Massacre by the Lakota Sioux, the Cheyenne and the Fukowi of XXXXXX and his 7th Cavalry at the Little Big Horn. At the time of its occurrence, June 25, 1876, "XXXXXX's Last Stand" was as big an incident and shock to the Americans' National Psyche as were the Japanese Attack on XXXXX XXXXXX (December 7, 1941) or the Atrocities perpetrated by the Islamic Fascists to New York's XXXX XXXXX XXXXXX and the United States' Armed Forces' Headquarters in the Pentagon, XXXXXXXXX, Virginia on September 11, 2002.<br /><br />JUST as so many films of that period of WORLD WAR II (and the years immediately before), there were so many incidents in it that were, if not intentionally done, were demonstrations of virtues that would be needed in time of another Global Conflict, such as we were in by the time of THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON was finishing up its original Theatrical release period.<br /><br />POODLE SCHNITZ!!
