With the Nazi rise to power in Eastern Europe in the late 1930's, XXXXXXX XXXXXXX turned his attention to creating a reaction to it. The catalyst may well have been a propaganda publication referring to XXXXXXX as a Jewish sympathizer. In The Great Dictator, XXXXXXX created a dead-on parody of XXXXXX that is as funny as it is frightening at times. The film traces XXXXXX's experiences in the German army from World War I up to the present day. Simultaneously, XXXXXXX plays a Jewish barber who dresses like the tramp who comes out of a hospital after a long long time, only to discover how different the world is under Nazi rule.<br /><br />XXXXXXXX XXXXXXX, XXXXXXX's wife at the time, plays a young Jewish girl whose family is oppressed in a Jewish ghetto. XXXX XXXXX has a great, Oscar-nominated supporting role as a Mussolini look-alike (XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX) who gives XXXXXXX's XXXXXX character, XXXXXXX XXXXXX, a lot of fits. XXXXX XXXXXXX is his usual staid self as XXXXXXXXX, chief adviser to XXXXXXX XXXXXX. XXXXXXX wrote and directed the film and received Oscar nominations for his screenplay and his acting. The film was also nominated for best picture.<br /><br />XXXXXXX made the film under tremendous pressure for some obvious reasons and some not so well known. He financed the entire film himself at great risk because of the subject matter, and there were no other major films made regarding Nazi Germany up to that time. The film spent about twenty-one months in production with XXXXXXX even rebuilding a set and re-shooting a scene to get things right. By the time of the film's release in October of 1940, the war in Europe was well under way with XXXXXX conquering one country after another, so the film became much more topical at its release than when production first began.<br /><br />There isn't much plot in looking at the film in retrospect; the film seems more like a series of comedy sketches and/or mishaps strung together to get to a purpose independent of the film itself. Several examples of this occur in the last third of the film with the meeting between XXXXXX and Napaloni. The scene is very very funny, but it leads no where in terms of the plot. Likewise, the escape of both the barber and XXXXXXX simply leads to the mistaken identity of the barber for XXXXXX in order to give XXXXXXX (through the barber character) an opportunity to pontificate to the audience at the end of the film. On the other hand, what better way to make a point about the misplaced narcissism of Aryan superiority than to have a Jewish Barber mistaken for XXXXXX? <br /><br />Still, the film contains many high comic moments, such as the rally speech, the new war developments (bulletproof uniforms, etc.), the dancing globe scene, the coin in the pudding scene, and the entire scenario between XXXXXX and Napaloni (including the barber chair scene) to highly recommend the film. One can also not forget the risks XXXXXXX took in making his first talking film, an anti-Nazi film, and financing the film himself. ***1/2 of 4 stars.
