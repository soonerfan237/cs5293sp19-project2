All-Monster congregation in the final film in Universal's renowned cycle of classic horror stories. XXXXX Dracula (an intense, dapper John Carradine), calling himself Baron Latos, comes to Dr. Edelmann (Onslow Stevens) asking to be cured of his affliction. Naturally, this is just a ruse. Then, coincidentally, XXXXX Talbot (Lon Chaney), a.k.a. "The Wolf Man", shows up and of course he *really* wants to be cured.<br /><br />As others have noted, the monsters don't get equal screen time. The Frankenstein Monster (XXXXX Strange) gets thrown in at the end just for the purpose of including all of the Universal Monsters. Stock footage and library music are re-used here as well. The film spends maybe a little too much time with the Dracula part of the story, although XXXXXXXXX gives an impressive, non-hammy performance in the role of the Count. The film is mainly a showcase for XXXXXXX, who goes through a tragic character arc of his own, and does an excellent job. The women are gorgeous, and I have to say that I loved XXXX Adams as the luminous nurse - who happens to be hunchbacked.<br /><br />Of course, it wouldn't be complete without the inclusion of angry villagers.<br /><br />Competently, professionally made chiller is, just for my tastes, not really scary at all, but entertaining regardless. It's a respectable series entry overall.<br /><br />7/10
