Relentless like one of those loud action movies. The entire cast seems to be on speed. I didn't quite get the director's intentions if any. I wonder if she's ever seen a Stanley Donen, XXXXXXX Minnelli or even a George Sidney musical. Structure, please! This is one hell of a mess and I loved XXXX. The costumes the unflattering photography - unflattering towards the actors but loving towards the locations) The one thing that makes the whole thing bearable is the sight of XXXXX Streep making a fool of herself. No chemistry with her friends (XXXXXXXXX Baranski and Julie Walters) think of Streep with Lily Tomlyn in the Altman film and you'll understand what I was hoping for. I was embarrassed in particular by XXXXXX Brosnam and Colin Firth. The audience, however, seemed to enjoy it so it probably it's just me.
