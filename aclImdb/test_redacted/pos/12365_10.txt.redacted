Körkarlen (1921), a classic film with cult status amongst the silent movies, directed by XXXXXX Sjöstrøm, who also plays the male main role, is based on a story by Swedish novelist Selma Lagerlöf. The film tells the story of brutal drinker XXXXX Holm, who beats up his wife, neglects his children, seduces his brother to drinking and is blind for the love of nurse Edit (Astrid Holm). XXXXX sits toward the end of the year together with his boozing buddies in the city-park and tells the story of the Phantom Chariot (Körkarlen): Who dies in the New Year's Eve night as the last one before dawn, has to serve one year long as driver of Death and release the dying souls from their bodies. But XXXXX gets into a fight with his buddies, suffers a hemorrhage and sinks dead on the soil. Meanwhile, the Phantom Carriage is approaching. The driver is nobody else than XXXXX's late friend Georges who seduced him into alcohol and died one year before. Since XXXXX refuses to get on the carriage, Georges forces him. Together, they drive to the stations where people live who suffered from XXXXX. They visit the nurse Edit whose love to XXXXX he was unable to recognize and whom he infected with tuberculosis so that she is dying now. But her unconditioned love to XXXXX will save his soul. Fulfilled with her spirit, they get to XXXXX's wife and children. XXXXX is able to prevent his wife from killing herself and her children, because she does not see a way out of the misery in which XXXXX has thrown her. They also visit XXXXX's brother, who has committed a murder after having been seduced into drinking by XXXXX. XXXXX asks Georges to go back into his body, because he finally sees that his way was wrong. Since it was XXXXXXX who had seduced him once into drinking, David's wish is granted, he gets a second chance, and XXXXXXX has to be one more year the driver of the Phantom Carriage in order to pay for his own sins. This movie belongs probably to the strongest and most impressive films ever made. Deplorably, it is still not available on international DVD.
