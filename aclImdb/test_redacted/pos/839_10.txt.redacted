The third and final XXXXXX XXXXXXXX Scorpion film directed by XXXXXX XXX. The series' star, XXXXX XXXX, would complete the series in the fourth installment, XXXXXX XXXX, directed by the capable XXXXXXXX XXXXXX (who also directed XXXX in the excellent XXXXX XXX XXXX: XXX XXXXXX). The original XXXXXX XXXXXXXX #701: Scorpion is one of my all-time favorites. The sequel, Jailhouse 41, is nearly as good. It's generally considered the best of the series, and I might agree, I think, if it ever gets a better release on DVD (the original, by XXXXX, is very poor). XXXXX Stable, in my opinion, is nearly as good as FP701. It's much slower, much more contemplative. It has its share of violence and nastiness, but there's more focus on the story and the characters. Sasori (XXXX) eludes detectives in the first scene (she is handcuffed to one and lops his arm off Â– and escapes with it in tow, which must be seen to be believed!) and hooks up with a freelance prostitute, XXXX. XXXX is being hassled by a local prostitution ring, which includes a goofy-looking madame with a cage full of pet crows. What really surprised me is how sad the movie is. XXXX's story, which is never resolved, it heartbreaking. The images are startling, and XXX's direction is masterful. It's too bad that he never went anywhere after he left the FP701 series. This is an awesome film.
