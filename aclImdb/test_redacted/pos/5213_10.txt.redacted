The only reason I decided to view this film is because of the great acting talents of XXXXX XXXXXX,(XXXXXX XXXXXXX),"XXX XXXXX",'99, who is deeply involved with XXXX XXXX,(XXXX),"XXX XXXX",'05, who is a great war hero and has all kinds of ways to make money and never seems to stop telling LIES. XXXXXX and XXXX are trying to rebuild an old home and restore it to comfortable living conditions. The relationship gets troublesome and XXXXXX decides to find out what is going on and the plot gets very mysterious. If you are a big fan of XXXXX XXXXXX, this is the film for you. I only wish XXXXX would appear in more films, I miss her great talents.
