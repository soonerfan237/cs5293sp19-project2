WHAT WAS HE THINKING?!?!?! How sad an actor as tremendously talented as XXXXXXX Rapaport- who stole our hearts in "Mighty Aphrodite" and fascinated us in "Ill Town"- has sunk to this pathetic level. The writing on this sitcom is the crust left on the bottom of the barrel after it has been scraped. Shame on all involved. There is a trend: major movie actors that are no longer hot merchandise are turning to TV- often with disastrous results (reference the stinkaroos on CBS and NBC; however, ABC has a hit with "XXXXXX Legal"- hip writing and great nostalgic use of Bill Shatner). To waste XXXXXXX Rapaport in this "All In The Family" rip-off is an insult to viewers and mostly XXXXXXX himself.
