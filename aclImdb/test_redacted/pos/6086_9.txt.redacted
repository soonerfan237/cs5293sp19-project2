It is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see "The English Patient" again after XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX's death. Most of his body of work is dedicated to one shattering point. The endless moral struggle of those who, consciously, walk a very thin line. In "The Talented Mr Ripley" XXXXXXXXX moves away from XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX's amoral XXX XXXXXX to give the murderer a conscience. In "Breaking And Entering" XXXXXXXXX gives XXXX XXX's character the need to confess and the rewards are chillingly moving. Here, in "The English Patient", the characters in love are never too far away from their corroding feeling of guilt. XXXXX Finnes and XXXXXXX XXXXX XXXXXX are extraordinary. They strip their characters from every pretense in a compelling complicity with us, the audience. XXXXXXXX XXXXXXX is, quite simply, spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful XXXXXX XXXXXXX are filled with a "Minghellian" sensual innocence. XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX gave us films that were,one way or another, that elusive mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself but thought about his audience. He knew how to push our buttons without betraying his own. There is something clear, honest and startling about XXXXXXXXX's opus. I miss him already but I'm grateful for the reflection of his soul he left behind.
