One of the better musical bios. XXXXXX Morgan is great as the singer/composer Chauncey Olcutt. The supporting cast is very good, especially XXXXXX King as the glamorous Lillian Russell. The turn of the century atmosphere is the perfect setting. The technicolor is excellent. A simple plot, but the movie just makes you feel good. XXXXXX was always underrated as an actor and a singer.
