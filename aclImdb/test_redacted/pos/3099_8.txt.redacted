This as the first of the Ma and XX XXXXXX flicks. XXXXXXXX Main (Ma) steals the show in anything she does. Funny to see XXX XXXXX as XXXXX, the daffy old lady on the train.. god she was ALWAYS old; she was in "Desk Set" and "XXXXXX XXXXXXXXX Presents". Their new house is also a co-star here -- its the house of the future with some really cool inventions that XX doesn't care for. LOVE the painting gag. Keep an eye out for TOM... he starred in "Nanny & the Professor". Unfortunately he died real young... oddly enough, his last role was on the series "XXXXX XXXXXX". weird. Directed by XXXXXXX XXXXXX, who not only directed several of the Kettle films, he also did a bunch of the Abbott and Costello flicks, so he must have known a thing or two about comedy. Fun story, plain, simple humor. Even the release date was April XXXX's day, 1949. The story starts out by showing us what backward and country-folk they are (the neighbors are even Native Americans), but as the story progresses, we have sympathy and respect for them.
