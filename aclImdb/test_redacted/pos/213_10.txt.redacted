Two years after the success of 'Airplane', XXX XXXXXXXX and XXXXX & XXXXX XXXXXX created this brilliant sitcom starring the great XXXXXX XXXXXXX as plain clothed detective 'Frank XXXXXX'. Also in the cast was XXXX XXXXX as 'Captain Ed XXXXXX', XX XXXXXXXX as 'Ted Olsen' and XXXXXXX XXXXX as 'Johnny The Shoe Shine Boy'. 'Police Squad!' featured unashamedly corny jokes and clever visual gags playing in the background. Each episode would conclude with a mock freeze frame in which the characters in frame stand completely still. One of the best 'freeze frame' sequences saw one of the characters pouring coffee into a cup while standing still, causing the cup to overflow! Guest stars were killed off in the opening titles, one included XXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXX being crushed by a falling safe! Despite gaining positive reviews and much critical acclaim, 'Squad!' only lasted for six episodes before being cancelled. This didn't mean the end though, five years later the show was transferred to the big screen for the first in the trilogy of the 'Naked Gun' films.
