Had it with the one who raised you since when you were young? You just want her gone from your life? That woman is your mother. You should respect her, you should honor her, whether she's in sick or well. But that in times, it can be aggravating. Especially when she becomes very overbearing. That's how Owen(XXXXX DeVito) had to deal with in "Throw Momma Fron The Train". His Momma(XXXX Ramsey, 1929-88), is one of the worst. He trying his best to be a writer, and she is everything but grateful. Calls him a "clumsy poop", a "larda$$", and "fat" and "stupid". For his friend, XXXXX Donner(Billy Crystal) he has his own woman problems, his ex-wife. She trying to discredit him. So what did XXXX do? Push her overboard. What does he do? Help return the favor, get rid of Mrs. Lift! In the kitchen scene, I liked it where XXXX called Larry, "Cousin Patty". And XXXXX said, "You don't have a Cousin Patty!" and XXXX shouts "You Lied To Me!" and XX Cabongs Larry with the frying pan. Then comes the fun part when they where on the train and try to kill XXXXX Lift. That is thwarted, and she kicks XXXXX off the train. Well, everything back to normal, the ex-wife lives, but XXXXX kicked the bucket on her own. Maybe she should have seen the errors of her domineering ways. A fun movie it is, and the cast is great. A classic! 5 stars!
