*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*<br /><br />I thought XXXXX XXXXX to be quite enjoyable, with some nice effects--I liked the larger beasts, although they aren't a patch on the Aliens from the Alien series. It had quite a good atmosphere, which I felt XXX XXXXXX helped contribute toward.<br /><br />One thing which kind of stumped me was how it rained. If the planet has three suns and is in almost continuous daylight, where did the moisture come from to form clouds and therefore rain?<br /><br />I liked the fact that XXX died at the end--it reminded me of the New Hollywood films of the 1970s, with the main heroine not making it to the end.
