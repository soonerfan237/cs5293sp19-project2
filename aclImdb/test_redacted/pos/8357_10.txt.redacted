Hilarious film, I had a great time watching it. The star (Cuneyt Arkin, sometimes credited as XXXXX Arkin) is a popular actor from Turkey. He has played in lots of tough-guy roles, epic-sword films, and romances. It was fun to see him with an international cast and some real lousy looking pair of gloves. If I remember it was also dubbed in English which made things even more funnier. (kinda like seeing XXXX Wayne speak Turkish).
