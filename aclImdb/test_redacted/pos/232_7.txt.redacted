Although the plot of XXXXX XXXX is very flimsy and tired, it does serve well enough as an anchor for the Kern and Gershwin musical numbers. Following her signature role in Gilda, XXXXXXXX opted to star in this musical that seems tailor made for her. Besides looking as gorgeous as ever, she impresses with her dancing as well. XXXX Kelly, who was on loan to Columbia from MGM, matches her in dancing and the sequence where he cavorts with his own shadow was nicely done. The supporting characters were also competently acted. Personally, I didn't enjoy XXXXX XXXX as much as the musicals XXXXXXXX made with XXXX XXXXXXX. However, XXXXX XXXX is still very entertaining and easy to recommend. My score: 7/10.
