But quite dated today. XXXX Preminger made this movie without the certificate of approval that was needed then. It was enormously courageous and risky as he could have lost his investment and future.<br /><br />The film is not true to the wonderful book and is unfortunately hollywoodized.<br /><br />XXXXX XXXXXXX (and I've never been a fan) playing XXXXXXX XXXXXXX, is astonishing in his performance. One forgets it is XXXXX up there, the level of realism he brings to the role of a jonesing drug addict has to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />XXX XXXXX, eternally gorgeous and talented, does not disappoint in the role of the devoted outsider, always there for XXXXXie.<br /><br />Supporting roles, particularly a young, handsome and talented XXXXXX XX XXXXX, are faultless.<br /><br />Eleanor Parker, playing XXXXXie's wife, is hopelessly inept. She swings from irritating to melodramatic and is far too over the top. A forgettable performance.<br /><br />The stagey, cheap settings are appalling, as if a firm gust of wind would blow the whole tacky painted cardboards over the horizon. Almost laughable at times in their tawdry cheapness.<br /><br />The music was irritating, poundingly so at times. As if each nuance of the script (example: when XXXXX is getting XXXXXie his fix out of a drawer) had to be underscored at a high decibel level.<br /><br />7 out of 10. Sinatra truly deserved his Oscar nomination. Worth seeing.
