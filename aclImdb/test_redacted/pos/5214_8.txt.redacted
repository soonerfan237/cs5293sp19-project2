This is one of the best TV movies I have ever seen! The title makes it so obvious and predictable but come on, all TV movies are like that!<br /><br />The story is fantastic. It may seem ridiculous but it is based on an incredibly true story. XXXX Cole plays a military man named Dave who feels trapped in his marriage. He abandons his wife and kids and then fakes his death! All so he could be with Alyson (XXXXX Sillas). How far will Dave go to keep his secret? <br /><br />The acting is top notch for TV movies. XXXX Cole especially keeps the movie together as a charming, smooth-talking sociopath who has an answer to everything when his wife gets suspicious. XXXXX Sillas does the best she can as a wife who discovers that her husband is a LIAR and doesn't know what to do about it. XXXXX Siddall, who I believe is Gary Cole's wife in real life, plays her part well especially when she cries about the "death" of her husband. XXXXX Makkena adds a nice touch as Alyson's sister. XXXXX Goranson is great in her small role as Dave's mother.<br /><br />Predictable but the acting and the story take this movie up several notches.
