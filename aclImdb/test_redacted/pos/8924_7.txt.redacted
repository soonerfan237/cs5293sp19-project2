This movie was clearly an early attempt for a new director, but still succeeded in being original and entertaining as well as in some moments thought-provoking. However, I have to say the story would not have come across as well without the stellar performance of XXXX Anthony as Pip. He made the well written parts very believable and affecting, and the more weakly written parts much more bearable. Also, I have to mention the performance by XXXX Cumming. It was refreshing to see him in a part like this. He brought a weight to his role that provided a very grounding element to the film. As for XXXX Anthony: Who is this guy? Why haven't I seen more of him? XXXXXXX give him more roles, please!
