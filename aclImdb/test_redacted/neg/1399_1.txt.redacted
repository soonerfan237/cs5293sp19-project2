This is one of the most ridiculous westerns that XXXXXXXXX ever made. XXXX Cooper plays 'Reb Hollister', a former confederate officer wanted by the law. He meets up with a moron named XXXXXXXXX, played by Leif Erickson, who is a U.S. XXXXXXX with no knowledge of firearms. Weatherby is on his way to Dallas to see his fiancee, XXXXX Robles, played by Ruth Roman. Senor XXXXXX, Tonia's father, has plenty of men, but they can't seem to be able to keep an eye on his cattle, which are regularly rustled by the Marlow brothers. Will XXXXXX, played by Raymond Massey, has financed the loan on the Robles estate, making things completely absurd. He even has the power to call for mortgage payments before they're due, simply because he feels like it.<br /><br />Since XXXXXXXXX is a Boston boy who can't fight, since he only became a Marshal so he could visit his fiancee, Tonia, (Just another instance of more plot nonsense. Are we to assume that you only have to pass a written test to get this job? Wait a minute, this guy couldn't pass the written test either.) he switches identities with XXX Hollister, who of course is an expert gunman. Reb takes the liberty of greeting XXXXXXXXX's girl with a passionate kiss, while XXXXXXXXX looks on like an idiot. XXXX Cooper, Hollywood's number one stud, is in fine form here as Reb. Before the movie's done, not only does he take XXXXXXXXX's job, he steals his fiancee also, and Ruth Roman as Tonia, falls for him so hard and so fast that she gives chump Leif Erickson the brush-off before the films little more than half over.<br /><br />There isn't a shred of plot credibility in the whole film, so despite the good cast and lush photography, the film is a dud. And XXXXXX's character is a complete heel to boot. The film also stars XXXXXXX Payton as Brant Marlow's girl, a beautiful and talented actress who squandered away her chances, unfortunately, by making too many headlines for the wrong reasons. I strongly suggest you pass this one up.
