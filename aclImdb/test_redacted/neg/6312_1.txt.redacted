This movie has some of the worst acting I've ever seen. XXXXXX Quaid's performance was high school caliber. While it's difficult to portray an off-the-wall character like XXXXX Lee Lewis, it can be done. Just ask XXXXX Foxx (although Ray Charles had more depth to his personality and musicianship than Lewis ever dreamed of possessing). The Phillips brothers portrayal belonged in The Dukes of XXXXXXX, and Alec Baldwin playing Jimmy Swaggart is a bit like Donald Duck performing Shakespeare. When XXXXXX Duvall played a country preacher, I bought it. Baldwin never made me believe a single word. XXXXXX Ryder's part was the best, and she was mediocre. (And can anyone figure out how she was 13 when XXXXX met her and still 13 more than a year later?) Some checking on the Internet reveals the essential facts presented by the film were true, at least no more fouled-up than most Hollywood bio pics. This film did badly at the box office, and it should have.
