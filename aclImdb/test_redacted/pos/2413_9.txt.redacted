For once a sequel to "The Karate Kid" without XXXXX Macchio! XXXXXX Swank did an excellent job playing the orphan Julie Pierce. XXX Morita, the one who plays Mr. Miyagi worked his way with Julie quite different from Daniel. Both XXXXXX and Julie favored karate. Unlike XXXXXX, Julie was the most surly person Miyagi ever challenged. And there was no tournament to compete in. And there's gonna be some humor in this movie as well. I liked the part where when XXXXX came home from school, Miyagi went to check on her, and saw her change clothes in the process. That was very funny! And the classic "XXX on, XXX off" scene was different as well. It was funny when XXXXXX tells Julie, "Uh-oh, missed spot". The set in Boston was a far cry from California. The Militant group in that group, was like the "XXXXX Kai" in Boston. And XXXXXXX Ironside's Col. Dugan was no John Kreese. His group practically deserted him when XXXXX kicked some serious butt. They all paid the price when they blew up that classic Oldsmoblie. What a cowardly act. At least they'll find redemption from Dugan's poison. This Karate Kid sets some morals, unlike the last three, which talked about "Honor" and "Respect". XXXXXX Swank is outstandingly hot in any movie and everything else she does. Movie 9, XXXXXX Swank 10!
