Directed by XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX (Cat People, Out of the Past, XXXXX of the Demon) and written by XXXXXXX XXXXX (How Green was My Valley) XXXX of the Indies is a quite interesting adventure pirate movie. Its main character of captain XXXX Providence is based on a real woman-pirate XXXX Boney who actually lived and sailed through 18th century's Atlantic.<br /><br />The film begins with the sea battle where XXXX's (Jean Peters) pirate ship attacks a trade ship that was on its way to Europe from the South America. As a result a treasure of great value is captured along with a handsome French officer XXXXXX XX XXXXXXXX (XXXXX XXXXXXX), who is taken prisoner. XXXX ends up falling in love with him and apparently her feelings are reciprocated but it's only till she sets him free when she discovers that he has a beautiful young wife Molly (XXXXX XXXXX) with whom he pretty much in love with. XXXX begins planning revenge on both of them but in an unexpected twist of fate ends up making a great sacrifice in order to save them instead. The pirate movie cliché figure of `XXXXX XXXXX' also makes his appearance here, this time played by XXXXXX Gomez.<br /><br />Though XXXX of the Indies probably appears to be no more nor less than a revisiting of pirate movie clichés, it still has its classical moments in beautiful visuals and sea battle sequences filmed in Technicolor as well as in some aspects of the story and most of all in personal touches in directing of all of it by XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX. 7/10
