It wasn't until I saw XXXXXX Pollack in the picture that I ever connected him to this film. This is his worst possible movie. Absolute dreck. The dialog is wooden and unbelievable, the plot is unbelievable.<br /><br />XXXXXXX Scott Thomas is wasted in this movie. There is nothing about her character that makes you even want to believe in this story.<br /><br />XXXXXXXX Ford is like on Valium. There is no life in his eyes.<br /><br />I blame XXXXXX Pollack for the failure of this movie. The script is awful, and he is too smart to not see that. So it smacks of some kind of payoff, whether of a studio obligation or something else, but this is just BLOODY ROTTEN!
