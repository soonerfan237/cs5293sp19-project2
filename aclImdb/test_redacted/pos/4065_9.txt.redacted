"Showtime" is a funny film starring funnymen XXXXXX XXXXXX (Meet the Parents,A XXXXX XXXX) and XXXXX XXXXXX (XXXXX, Dr. Dolittle). The story is this: In the beginning of the movie detective XXXXX (XXXXXX XXXXXX) and another detective go into a tv store trying to bust some criminals. When the cops arrive, Tray(XXXXX XXXXXX)a cop, tries to arrest XXXXX not knowing he's a cop. During this scene loads of funny things happen which catch the eye of tv producer XXXXX XXXX. She is so excited about their adventures together, she decides to make a tv show called "Showtime" starring Tray (the cop) and XXXXX (the detective). But that's just the funny part. The rest is strictly suspense and action. There is a foreign man who is selling and making extremely dangerous guns. While playing LAPD on the show and doing it in real life, DeNiro and Murphy have quite an adventure in this story. On a scale of 1-10, I give it a seven or 8.
