What starts as a homespun comedy-drama and then halfway turns into a melodrama made a major star of XXXX Garfield - and justly so. But XXXXXXX Lynn is not to be dismissed as the object of affection of the four daughters. Lynn is very handsome and is so charming it's easy to believe that all four daughters could fall for him. Although XXXXXXXX received most of the kudos, Lynn became a major leading man at Warner Bros. as a result of this film.<br /><br />Michael Curtiz insisted on location shooting for the picnic scene, making it the highlight of the film. Throughout, the craftsmanship is enough to inspire awe. A soap opera by XXXXX Hurst has been turned into a cinema masterpiece.
