This meandering tale of mob revenge is simply not very interesting, even with XX McMahon in a ripe role as the chief heavy. XXX Brown kicks ass effectively, Gloria Hendry proves again that she can bring life to even the poorest roles, and Brock Peters is decent as The Cop Who Plays By the Book. It's still dull and badly constructed, and even the print shown on cable is now emasculated of its original XXXXX Brown score.
