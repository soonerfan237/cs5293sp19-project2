Critics are a strange kind of people. Some of them are common people like you and me. Some of them are not. When a critic say XXXXXXXXXXX Cruelty is beautiful I wonder where they did grow up? What's beautiful with filming a field, some clouds or a tree with an old camera if you can't do it with style and capture the mood of the environments. XXXXX Hussain for sure can't. I've seen kids do better footage than XXXXX manage to do in Subconscius Cruelty. But that's not the worst part. The worst part is the whole recording, I refuse to call this a film, is just a bad excuse to picture nudity and extreme torture, rapes of both sexes, masturbation, sperm, pissing, cannibalism, child-murder and much much more. I love gore/splatter and I love horror. This ain't neither of those. This is utter crap and if my comments make just one single person skip XXXXXXXXXXX Cruelty it's been worth it. Always remember that your life won't last forever, don't waste two hours of precious time on XXXXXXXXXXX Cruelty. You've been warned.
