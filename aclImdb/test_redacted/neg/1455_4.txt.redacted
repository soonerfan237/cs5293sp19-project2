Overrated mob comedy. XXXXXXXX Demme makes the actors pause after some funny lines to let audience laugh, and not miss next line. Seems odd - this director did "Silence of The Lambs" - now there's the way to use pauses! Casting seems off. XXXXXX Modine too young for FBI agent and Pfeiffer's love interest! Dean XXXXXXXXX is doing a Jack Nicholson-thing with a squint, and he gets a nomination for it! Plus we have to accept XXXXXXXX and Stockwell as Italians? XXXXXXX Napier as a hairdresser and Al Lewis as a mob lawyer are underused with only one line each - they should be the bumbling hoods. Song score by XXXXX Isaak is totally out of place - better for a flick like "Pretty In Pink." Re-make this movie, it's worth it, but with proper casting and director and the satire will come through... even the often repeated "Forgedaboutit."
