Computer savvy XXXX Light (as XXXX Elias) goes from Stanford drop-out to successful young Dotcom-era tycoon. But, XXX Light's sneering success could be short-lived, with partners like ambitious Jeffrey Donovan (as Robert Jennings). XXX Donovan used to bed down with Light's girlfriend, Megan Dodds (as Lisa Forrester). XXXXXXX wants Light to know that binge drinking and casual sex don't have to end in college. After reading a naughty Internet sex session, Ms. Dodds shines XXXXX on. He may lose is "Digital Dreams" Internet empire, too! Veterans unsuccessfully trying to lending dramatic gravitas include red lollipop-sucking Mia Farrow (as XXXX Simmons) and quick-drawing, computer-hating Hal Holbrook (as Tom Walker). Ms. Farrow looks sweet with her lollipops.<br /><br />*** Purpose (2/21/02) XXXX Lazar ~ John Light, Jeffrey Donovan, Mia Farrow
