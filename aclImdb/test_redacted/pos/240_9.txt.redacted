In Brooklyn, the nightclub dancer XXXXX XXXXXX (XXXX XXXXXXXX) has a simple but happy life dancing in the McGuire's, owned by her boyfriend XXXXX (XXXX XXXXX). Rusty, XXXXX and XXXXXX (XXXX XXXXXXX) have a ritual on Friday nights: they order oysters in a bar, trying to find a pearl. The life of Rusty changes when she participates and wins a contest to be the cover page of the Vanity magazine. She is invited to work in a huge theater in Broadway, whose owner proposes her. She loses her happiness and starts drinking in her new life style, missing the love of XXXXX and her old friends. 'Cover XXXX' is a delightful romantic comedy, very naive and having magnificent parts, such as the beauty and talented XXXX XXXXXXXX dancing, singing and acting; XXXX XXXXX, specially in two scenes, dancing with himself and with Rusty and XXXXXX on the street; the songs and the choreography of the dances are also spectaculars. XXXXX, the character of XXXX XXXXX, is almost nasty with his chauvinist behavior. XXXX XXXXXXXX surprised me with her talent: I found her amazing in 'Gilda', but she is stunning in 'Cover XXXX'. In accordance with the information on the cover of the VHS, 'Cover XXXX' was the first musical where the songs were part of the plot, giving continuity to the story, instead of just being 'thrown' in the movie. My sixteen years old son saw this movie with a friend of the same age in a recent XXXX XXXXX festival and they loved 'Cover XXXX', therefore I dare to say that this classic is recommended to any movie lover and not only to the old generations. My vote is nine.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): 'Modelos' ('Models')
