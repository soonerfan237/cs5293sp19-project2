I was blown away when I saw "The Best Years of Our Lives". The acting, script, and XXXXXX XXXXXXX XXXXX's Direction(winner of XXXX XXXXXXXX in 1946)is Brilliant.<br /><br />The film is about XXXXX World War II veteran's who come home together on a plane and all by chance live in the same town. They all are reunited with their families.<br /><br />The first man XX XXXXXXXXXX(Played by XXXXXXX XXXXX in his Oscar winning role) has to adapt to his wife XXXXXX(played by XXXXX XXX) and Children Peggy and Rob(played by XXXXXX XXXXXX and XXXXXXX XXXX) being different than before he left for the war.<br /><br />The second man XXXX XXXXX(played by XXXX XXXXXXX in an excellant role) has to find a good job and adapt to a wife he had only been married to 20 days before he left for the war. He begins to find out that she is not the same.<br /><br />The third man Has a much more harder adaptation to make. XXXXX Parish(played by XXXXXX XXXXXXX in his excellant oscar role)He has lost his hands in the war and must deal with his family's and fiance' XXXXX's(played by XXXXX O'Donnell) reactions to the hooks he has instead of his hands. All of these men and their families are reunited in the film in different scences. The stories of these men are all interwoven beautifully together.<br /><br />This film truly defines the meaning of a "Classic". This unforgettable drama(winner of best picture in 1946) is a film that everyone should see.<br /><br />If I was asked to pick a favorite film I would pick this one.<br /><br />Out of 10 I would give "The Best Years of Our Lives" An 11.<br /><br />So the next time you rent a movie rent this one you won't regret it.
