I was fortunate to attend the London premier of this film. While I am not at all a fan of British drama, I did find myself deeply moved by the characters and the BAD CHOICES they made. I was in tears by the end of the film. Every scene was mesmerizing. The attention to detail and the excellent acting was quite impressive.<br /><br />I would have to agree with some of the other comments here which question why all these women were throwing themselves at such a despicable character.<br /><br />*******SPOLIER ALERT******** I was also hoping that XXXXX would have been killed by XXXXXXX when he had the chance! ****END SPOILER*****<br /><br />XXXXX XXXXXXXXX did a great job and radiate beauty and innocence from the screen, but it was XXXXXX XXXXXX's performance that was truly XXXXX worthy.<br /><br />I am sure this production will be nominated for other awards.
