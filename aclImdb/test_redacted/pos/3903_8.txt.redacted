After learning that her sister XXXXX is contemplating divorce, XXXX decides to travel to the distraught woman's remote country home and spend some time with her. When XXXX arrives, however, XXXXX is nowhere in sight. That's because someone has murdered her and stuffed the body in a trunk in the basement. As a storm rages outside, XXXX tries to figure out where her sister could have gone and places her own life in great danger...the killer is still on the premises! In her first post-BEWITCHED vehicle, XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX gives a solid dramatic performance. XXXXXX XXXXXX's teleplay is based on a short story by McKnight XXXXXX. XXXXXX's tale was first brought to television in 1962 as an episode of XXXXX XXXXXXX's THRILLER anthology series. THRILLER stuck very closely to the story, which is kind of a pity, for it could have used a little punching up. Granted XXXXXX wrote a moderately creepy number, but XXXXXX (creator of the ONE STEP BEYOND show) adds several clever ingredients that heighten the tension and suspense.
