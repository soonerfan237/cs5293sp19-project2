Alright, so maybe the impersonations of XXX XXXX and XXXXX XXXXXXXXX are not spot on, but you still get a sense of who these people are and how they operate behind the screen. XXX Balaban and XXXXX XXXXXXXX are excellant as XXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXX Ovitz.<br /><br />The movie doesn't go for joke and punchline but it is still funny. XXXXX Bates in particular is amazing as XXXX's manager.<br /><br />Funny, amazing, interesting, very watchable, this is a good TV movie.
