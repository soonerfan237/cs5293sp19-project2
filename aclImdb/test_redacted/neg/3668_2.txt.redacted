Misguided, miscast, murky, interminable lunacy given the high-gloss MGM A-budget treatment. XXXX Hepburn plays a bride who comes to suspect her rich, handsome husband (Robert Taylor)is not the dreamboat she married but a psychotic killer. MGM's attempt at a Hitchcockian thriller is doomed from the start by a turgid, muddled, ludicrous script, and the idiotic casting of XXXXXXX as a jeopardized woman fearing for her life (who could ever imagine XXXXXXX afraid of anything?) XXXXX B. Mayer forgot to tell Vincent Minnelli he was directing a thriller, not a musical. Taylor is embarrassing. Only XXXXXX Mitchum, also cast-against-type as a good guy, retains his dignity in a quiet, low-keyed performance. XXXX Freund's ravishing cinematography creates images of eerie beauty--and was wasted on the wrong film. End result: XXXXX's "Parnell" of the 1940s.
