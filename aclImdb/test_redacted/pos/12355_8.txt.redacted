XXXXX Baby, is another Pam Grier Blaxploitation film. It was one of XXX's less visceral films of this genre. Pam plays XXXXX Shane, who's a Chicago gumshoe. Sheba's father is the owner of a small loan company, in Missouri. When local mobsters try to run her father of of business, XXXXX goes after the bad guys.<br /><br />Pam Grier had already made her mark in Blaxploitation films, by the time XXXXX Baby came along. Fans of both Coffy and XXXX Brown, know that Pam is capable of an explosive intensity as an actress. In Sheba Baby, the fiery performance that viewers had come to expect from Pam, wasn't as evident in this film. Not that XXX doesn't kick-butt in Sheba Baby. She's just not as much of a runaway-train vigilante, as she was in her previous Blaxploitation films.<br /><br />The supporting cast in this film, are a distinct disappointment. So XXXXX Baby is Pam's film, through and through. And though XXX's a bit more subdued than in her other films, she still gives a compelling performance in Sheba Baby. This film is definitely worth your time, if you're an ardent XXX Grier fan.
