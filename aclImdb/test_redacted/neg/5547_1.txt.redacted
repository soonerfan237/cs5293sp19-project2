Give H.G. XXXXX points: He managed to incorporate beefy exotic dancers, gallons of his notorious fake blood, and Henny Youngman all in one movie. "The XXXX XXXX Girls" was Lewis's horror film swan song, and ends with a head being squashed by an automobile. Oh... XXXXX plays a surly night club owner whose girls are falling prey to Lewis's standard butchery.
