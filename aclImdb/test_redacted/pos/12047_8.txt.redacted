This was XXXXXXXXX's answer to Fatal attraction and this is a classic film in its own right. XXXX Chawla was good and so was Sunny Deol but it was Shah Rukh Khan who shot to fame as the stalker. Since then he has become a favourite of the Chopra's (Dilwale Dulhaniya le XXXXXXX, Mohhabatein, Dil to pagal hai, Veer Zaara and Chak De India). XXXX Rukh at first appears to be a villain but then towards the end you start to sympathize with him. The scripting was superb and the songs were chartbusters. My favourites are Too mere samne and XXXXX teri nazar.<br /><br />After the dismal failure of the underrated Lamhe Yash Chopra fought back with Darr. The dialogues were memorable, the k..k..Kiran dialogue is often repeated. Since XXXX Yash Chopra has slipped bit. Dil to pagal hai was bad but he redeemed himself slightly with XXXX Zaara, which was far far better. This was XXXX Chopra's last masterpiece.
