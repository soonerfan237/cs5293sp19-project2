Although this movie doesn't have the darkness of the books, it is in my opinion a great movie. It's great campy fun with the beautiful XXXXXX XXXXXXXX as XXXXXX. He may not have the blond hair and blue eyes that are so vividly described in the book, but to be fair, he would not look good with blond hair, and XXXXXX is most definitely about looking good. He moves like the predator I always imagined XXXXXX would have.<br /><br /> The visual effects are pretty good, and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing. It's not Interview with the Vampire, so don't try to compare the two. Interview is XXXXX' story. This is a cut and paste version of XXXXXX's. In any case, I highly recommend.
