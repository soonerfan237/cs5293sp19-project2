A British twist on Harold and XXXXX, Driving Lessons features a reined-in Rupert Grint and an over-the-top Julie Walters. While it is true that XXXXX is stone-faced like a redheaded Benjamin Braddock for the first half of the movie, it does not deter from the quirky family film--there are things going on that are out of his character's experience that would create a shell-shocked reaction. The chemistry between Walters and XXXXX carries the film, though Laura Linney's hard work to make her written stereotype human is also notable. These performances combined with a fun poppy soundtrack with artists like XXXXXX Stevens, John Renbourn and Salsa Celtica make this kids popcorn flick worth a Saturday afternoon.
