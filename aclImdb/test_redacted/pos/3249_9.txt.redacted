Two Hands restored my faith in Aussie films. It took an old premise and made it fresh. I enjoyed this movie to no end. I recommend it to those people who like XXX Ritchie films. XXXXX Brown was fantastic and just about perfect in a role tailor made for him. XXXXXX was adequtely dumb and his performance anchored a very satisfying movie for me.
