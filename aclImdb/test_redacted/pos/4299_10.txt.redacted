XXXXX XXXXXXX's maze-like novel 'A Way Through the Wood' has been adapted by XXXXXX XXXXXXXX who also directs this 'terribly British' drawing room suspense piece. It is a film whose effect relies on the cast portraying the varyingly benign/malignant characters and it is here that XXXXXXXX' directorial choices are superb. The story has a linear line that is easy to follow, but the beauty of the film is the metamorphosis of each player as a single incident ignites a minefield of disasters.<br /><br />XXXXX XXXXXXX (XXX XXXXXXXXX) is a successful business obsessed solicitor in London, married to XXXX (XXXXX XXXXXX) who needs more in her life: the couple being childless live in the country in a beautiful estate, assisted by their long term 'cleaner' XXXXXX (XXXXX XXXXXXX). They attend social outings and meet, among others, XXXXXXX XXXX (XXXXXX XXXXXXX), the passively lazy wealthy neighbor. XXXX decides they should entertain their neighbors and against gruff XXXXX' protestation XXXX proceeds with planning: XXXXX arranges to 'not attend due to business'. On the night of the party there is a hit and run accident in which XXXXXX's husband is accidentally killed by someone in a XXXXX XXXXX (she observed). When XXXXX returns home he sees a scratch on XXXXXXX's XXXXX XXXXX and suspects XXXXXXX to be the perpetrator. XXXX discourages XXXXX from going to the police with the information -'what possible good can it do but ruin XXXX's life as a socialite and father and son of an important scion?'. From this first 'lie' the virus spreads: XXXXX confronts XXXX who talks XXXXX out of going to the police, XXXX confesses it was she who was driving XXXX's Rover and is the one responsible, XXXXX convinces XXXX to keep it quiet because it would ruin his reputation, XXXX confesses she is having an affair with XXXX, and the three of them concur that they will stick together on their big lie for the sake of the greater good. XXXX eventually succumbs to the guilt of not telling her beloved XXXXXX that she is the one responsible and XXXXXX, herself guilty of a previous theft whose life was saved by XXXX's mercy to hire her anyway, is the agent who draws the story to its surprising conclusion. Lies begat lies that begat lies, et cetera.<br /><br />The major impact of this intrigue is the manner in which the isolated tragedy impacts each of the characters involved. Each changes in a dramatic way. XXXX XXXXXXXXX gives the finest performance of a career filled with brilliant performances: he is able to say more with his posture and facial expressions than about any actor before the audience today. Likewise the gifted XXXXX XXXXXX adds yet another fine role to her repertoire as does the surprisingly smarmy XXXXXX XXXXXXX who, despite being yet another wealthy British 'gentleman', gives us a man both arid of spirit and yet ultimately needy. And the always-fine XXXXX XXXXXXX takes a small role and finesses it making her character quietly central to the chaotic web of lies.<br /><br />The cinematography by Tony Pierce-Roberts and the musical score by XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX add immeasurably to the multiple atmospheres the story encounters. This is ensemble playing at its finest, which always means that the director (XXXXXX XXXXXXXX) has a fine grasp on the piece. The interplay of these fine people makes the dodgy story work very well indeed. XXXXX Harp
