This is so blatantly a made-for-TV ripoff of XXXXX Widow (1987) - even the insect titles are so similar.<br /><br />If you want a better "marrying for money" movie, check out XXXXX Widow, starring Debra Winger & Theresa Russell.<br /><br />These movie is cheesiness at its best..! I just had to watch it entirely to see how it ended.
