This thriller has so many twists and turns it had me on the edge of my seat. I saw it on video, some of the landscape at "the bluff" might have been a bit more spectacular on the big screen. Cast has XXXXXX XXXXXXX, XXX XXXXXXX (from "The Truth About Cats & XXXX"), XXXXXXX XXXX (XXXXX XXXXXX in "XXXXXX's Creek") and XXXX XXXXXXX (???).
