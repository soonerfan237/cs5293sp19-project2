"XXXXXXX" directed by Luis Bunuel presents an extraordinary view of religion in Mexico. As written by the director and XXXXX Alejandro, his notable collaborator, this was a film that put Mexican cinema in the international map after receiving the Grand Prix in Cannes that year. It's a disturbing film because XXX Bunuel delves deep into what's wrong with the church.<br /><br />Nazarin, by all reckoning, is a saint. This young priest is seen living a life of poverty in a seedy pension of a city. He doesn't have enough for himself, but he doesn't mind parting with a coin when a beggar appears by his window asking for help. At the same time, he takes into his small room a prostitute that has been hurt in a fight with another woman. Andara, the woman repays his kindness by burning the room and the whole building! Nazarin is seen taking to the countryside begging for food. Andara and XXXXXXX, two prostitutes from his old town follow him. XXXXXXX's life parallels that of Jesus. In fact, this saintly figure makes a case for humility.<br /><br />Of course,Mr. XXXXXX had no religion in mind when he and Mr. Alejandro took it upon themselves to create this film. It's ironic how XXXXX welcomed him after this film was released because they saw it as showing Christian qualities, when in reality, this is an acerbic satire on the catholic church and its ministers.<br /><br />Francisco Rabal, the Spanish actor, makes a wonderful Nazarin. This was one of his best roles. XXX Rabal worked extensively in his native country, but also in Mexico and Argentina. XXXX Macedo, as Andara, is also excellent. XXXXX Lopez also makes a valuable contribution with her portrayal of Beatriz.<br /><br />A great film by one of the cinema's master film makers: Luis Bunuel.
