Some aspects of this production are good, such as the performances of XXXXXX Lansbury, George Hearn, Cris Groenendaal, and Sal Mistretta. But am I the only one who is distracted by the horrible performance by XXXXX Joslyn as Johanna? She is terrible! She slauters the songs with her screechy voice and overacts in a role she clearly doesn't understand. I also think the chorus isn't up to snuff. They drag the tempo and make the worst facial expressions. Overall, I think this production is okay, but XXXXXXX Todd can be so much more if done correctly. This production doesn't come near the level this material demands. The concert version with XXXXXX Hearn and Patti LuPone is much better.
