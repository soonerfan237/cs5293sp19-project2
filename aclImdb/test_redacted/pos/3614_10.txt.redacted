A beautiful, sensitive film that brings home the futility and cruelty of wars no matter what the so-called reasons. The performance of Cage and XXXX were quite impressive, but it is to the older Greek characters that go the highest praises. XXXXX XXXXX is as gorgeous as ever! Though some scenes seems a little long at times, this film will be a heavy Oscar contender.
