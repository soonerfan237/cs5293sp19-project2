I have not figured out what the chosen title has to do with the movie. This is another gathering of monsters just like the HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN. Not exactly a masterful plot, but XXXXXXXXX needed to capitalize again.<br /><br />Dr. Edelman (XXXXXX Stevens) is either very ambitious or over the top in the ego department. He is working on the cure to keep XXXXX Talbot from turning into the Wolf Man. XXXXXXX Count Dracula happens to drop by to get a fix on his vampirism. And rounding out the good doctor's experiments is the restoring of the Frankenstein monster's energy. Along the way, the kind hearted doctor's blood is tainted with that of Dracula.<br /><br />XXXX Carradine plays Dracula again. This time he is more convincing. XXX Chaney Jr. as usual is the soulful Wolf Man. XXXXX Strange is the Frankenstein monster, who has very little to do this outing. Also with mentionable roles are Lionel Atwill and XXXXXX O'Driscoll.
