XXX Rogers (as XXX) and sidekick Raymond Hatton (as Rusty) join Teddy Roosevelt's "Rough Riders". Soon, they get suspended in order to "Round-up" the killer of partner XXXXX Acuff (as Tommy) along the Mexican-U.S. border; they discover creepy gold runners in the process. Notice how, even suspended, XXX Rogers is able to get the Rough Riders to join in his Round-up! <br /><br />This is not one of the better XXX Rogers westerns. The fighting scenes look like choreographed dances. Rogers sings/yodels "XXXXX' Down the Trail", one of two relatively ordinary songs; and, a stand-out moment, overall. <br /><br />** Rough Riders' Round-up (3/13/39) XXXXXX Kane ~ Roy Rogers, Raymond Hatton, Lynne Roberts
