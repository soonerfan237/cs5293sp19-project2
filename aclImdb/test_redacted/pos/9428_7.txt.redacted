For the sake of propaganda during World War II, Sherlock Holmes was moved into the then-present. One of the results is "Sherlock XXXXXX and the Secret Weapon," starring a top XXXXXX, Basil Rathbone, along with Nigel Bruce, Lionel Atwill, Dennis Hoey and Kaaren Verne. It is XXXXXX' assignment to deliver a scientist, Dr. Franz Tobel (William Post Jr.) and his weapon design to the British government before the Germans can get him. Once the man reaches England, however, his troubles are just beginning. Can Holmes decode the message Dr. XXXXX left before falling into the hands of the vicious Moriarity, save the weapon and possibly the scientist too? This is an effective Holmes story, set in the atmosphere of Switzerland and blackout England. The series worked just fine in the present day. It was not without its problems, but those problems had nothing to do with the time period. Whose idea was it to make XXXXXX an idiot? XXXXX Bruce's characterization - aided and abetted by the scripts - has always been the false note. I much prefer the characterization of XXXXXX Hardwicke in the Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes series - there, he's attractive, intelligent and a believable companion for Holmes. In the Rathbone series, XXXXXX is often condescending and treats Watson like the bumbling fool that he is. However, in this particular film, XXXXXX has a chance to be quite helpful in several parts.<br /><br />I admit to being a complete sap for Rathbone's recitation from Richard II - "...this blessed plot, this earth, this England" - I can't imagine how much it meant to the Brits watching the film in 1942. XXXXXXXX Holmes really served his purpose.
