XXXXX XXXXX, as everyone knows, is the man. In this film, he portrays XXX XXXXX (1923-1994), a real martial artist who fought over 50 bulls with his bare handsand won (interesting guylook him up). Anyway, XXXXX only kills one bull in the film but it's a memorable scene and as the liner notes say, right up there with the zombie vs. shark scene in Zombi! The film also offers up loads of hand-to-hand combat and a decent plot to boot, though I don't believe all of it is true. This film is the first of the XXXXX trilogy XXXXX made and is recommended for fans of martial arts action. Finally, three neat little tidbits; part of the opening theme was used in XXXX XXXX Volume 1, XXXXX himself appears in the opening sequences, and that is because he trained XXXXX in real life for five years!
