I've rented this gem several times! It's a small, yet somehow sprawling masterpiece taking the viewer from Manhattan glitz to the beauty of the Greek islands. XXXX Cassavetes on-screen marriage to his real-life wife XXXX XXXXXXXX is on the rocks. He finds meaning in a fling with footloose XXXXX XXXXXXXX whom he finds in Greece while their daughter, played in her earliest film role by the pubescent XXXXX XXXXXXXX, falls for the son of the Greek shipping tycoon who is courting her mother on a yacht sailing in neighboring waters. Meanwhile, the immensely talented XXXX XXXXX plays a goatherd living in a cave with his Sony Trinitron. He has the "hots" for XXXXX XXXXXXXX's character until confronted by XXXX Cassavetes. All comes together at the end in a classic closing scene where all is reconciled. XXXX XXXXX, the goatherd, is seen dancing with his goat. This film is full of mysticism, beauty, young and old love, humor, sexiness, and more. See it!
