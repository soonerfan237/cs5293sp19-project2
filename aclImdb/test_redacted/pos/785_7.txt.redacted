Well, I'm an Italian horror big fan and I love movies from directors such Argento, XXXXX, XXXX XX and XXXX XX, only to quote the most famous. "La villa delle anime maledette" is one of the most unknown movie of this genre, shot when this kind of cinema began its crisis that continues still today, and director XXXXX XXXXXX sounds totally new to my ears (althoug he directed six movies... this is the price Italian directors have to pay to not work in Rome...) . But the film is not so bad. And it's absolutely not correct to talk about "trash". OK, the plot is not so original; it reminds me stuff like the Amytville series (the year is the same of "XXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX" by XXXXXXX XXXXXXX) or "Shock", the last work of XXXXX XXXX. But you have to think that this is the movie of a cinematographer (like XXXXX XXXX movies); so the most important thing is the atmosphere, not the story or the characters; atmosphere very well created by the use of light and by the camera movement. The rest remain in the background. I think the movie works; not so good, but works; it's surely better than a lot of Hollywoodian production like "the Haunting" which have a bigger budget, but not bigger ideas...
