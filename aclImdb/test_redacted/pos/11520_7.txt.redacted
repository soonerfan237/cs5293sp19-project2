Take away all parts of the movie that were "present" day and stick to the flashbacks. Then you would have had a great story. Faith and XXXX's story and their relationship was the best part. Diaz and XXXXXXXXX were wonderful. XXXXXXXX was ponderous to sit through. Surprised to see XXXXXX Danner as mom. She was great. Also look for XXXXXXX Bergen as the father, always like him (Sleeping with the Enemy). This is a very hippy, save the world, kind of film. Don't care for it much, but I recommend seeing it for XXXX's performance alone. She has excellent range and it should be used more. Eccleston is, as always, compelling. He's wonderful!
