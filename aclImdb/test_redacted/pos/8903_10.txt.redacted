wow! it's even better than I expected! the best animated XXXXXXX movie ever! and it feels so good to hear XXXXX XXXXX doing the voice of XXXXXXX again! I surely recommend it to everyone who likes the comic books of XXXXXXX! but I suggest that you go to see the french version, cause it surely is the best and you hear the original cast! did you know that XXXXX XXXXX has played XXXXXXX for nearly forty years? i think he did a marvelous job! and the song from XXXXXX XXXX at the end fits rally good to the end credits! the music is good, the drawings are good, the actors are wonderful... in a word: a masterpiece! go to see it! you will not regret this!
