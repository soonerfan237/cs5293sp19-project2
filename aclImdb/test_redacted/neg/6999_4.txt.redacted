XXXX Rudd (John Wayne) and sidekick Dink Hooley (Syd Saylor) are itinerant cowpunchers who can't seem to stay in one place very long. In "Helltown", the boys are headed to Montana, where they meet up with XXXX's cousin Tom Fillmore (Johnny Mack Brown), who offers them a job. It's a hoot to see the boys wearing aprons as they start out as cooks with the herd, although XXXX becomes self conscious when Miss Judith (Marsha Hunt) rides into camp. Judy is XXX's girl, but the attraction between her and Dare is evident early on.<br /><br />Fillmore has a cattle herd to move, and promotes Dare to running the drive, partly to prove to Judy that he may not be up to the task. Meanwhile, bad guy XXXX Hammond (Monte Blue) has his eyes on Fillmore's cattle, but when his henchmen fail to rustle the herd, he figures it's easier to win the money that Dare was paid at the end of the trail. Conning XXXX into a rigged card game with his man Brady (James Craig), XXXX's money begins to evaporate hand after hand. It's only when XXXX fails to show up back at Fillmore's ranch that Tom goes out to find his cousin. Exposing the cheats, XXX, Dare and Dink high tail it before the bad guys can get their revenge.<br /><br />"Helltown", also known as "Born to the West", was released in 1937 by Favorite Films Corporation, a couple of years after Wayne's series of Westerns for Lone Star Productions. It only slightly alters the Lone Star formula; XXXXX does get the girl at the end of the film, but here he was trying. There's a great runaway horse scene where XXXXX rescues Marsha Hunt, in which Johnny Mack Brown's horse does a complete somersault spill. XXX Saylor does a nice job as the comic relief pal, doing his best to sell lightning rods to unsuspecting victims. He replaces familiar faces XXXXXX "Gabby" Hayes and Yakima Canutt here, staples of the Lone Star films. XXXX Wayne's charisma is beginning to develop here, preparing him for the leap to super star status that he eventually achieved. <br /><br />"Helltown" was based on a novel by legendary Western author XXXX Grey. If you're looking for more films based on Grey's stories, try "Fighting Caravans" with XXXX Cooper, "The Light of Western Stars" with Victor Jory, "Drift Fence" with Buster Crabbe, and "Heritage of the Desert" with Randolph Scott.
