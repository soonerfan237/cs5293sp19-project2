A crackling and magnificent thriller about a child psychiatrist, XXXXXXXXX XXXXX (Jennifer Lopez) who is desperately urged by two FBI agents, XXXXX XXXXX (Vince Vaughn) and XXXXXX XXXXXX (Jake Weber) to use her therapy on XXXX XXXXXXXX (Vincent D'Ofornio), a serial killer who (uses strange and horrifying torture tactics) is found in a coma by the feds. What XXXXX wants in return from XXXXX is whereabouts of XXXXXXXX's latest victim is and if she's alive. Once XXXXX gets into XXXXXXXX's mind, which has the appearence and atmosphere that resembles a colorful combination of XXXXX XXXXX's "Dune" or "Blue Velvet" and XXX XXXXXX's "A Nightmare on Elm Street", the adventure begins. XXXXX sees a variety of odd people ranging from Carl as a youngster (an adorable XXXX XXXXXX) to a Freddy Krueger-like man minus the razor claws. I don't want to give away the ending, but the movie is great altogether besides the dynamite performances, XXXXXX XXXXX's creepy musical score and directing (by XXXXXX, who shows here that he can direct).
