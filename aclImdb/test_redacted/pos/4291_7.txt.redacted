Emily XXXXXX and XXX XXXXXXXXX together - what a treat! With XXXXXX XXXXXXX and XXXXX XXXXXXX rounding off the supporting roles to the foursome of lies and intrigue. Yet at the heart of it all, each character maintains a streak of decency - moral conscience held up in spite of obvious contradictions. "Contradictions are the source of all movement and of all life." How true these words are. XXXXXX's XXXX XXXXXXX is at the core of this intrigue - she's the central conscience that the other three latched on. She is the decency undeterred. <br /><br />The circumstances of lies are to each its own: one to defend one's professional name; one to hold back due to family/partner pressure; one simply don't want to face the consequence; one ironically can't believe the truth and lies to save friendship. These are all precarious situations. There lies the intrigue - fascinating to watch how each tackles truth and lies. Contradictions, indeed. In spite of the seeming dishonor, decency and heart remain strong. <br /><br />The treatment of the subject involved and how each of the character behaves are masterfully delivered simple with clarity. It's not sensational or complex as another film "Where the Truth Lies" 2005. Credits due to XXXXXXXX' writing and the nuanced performances of both XXXXXX and XXXXXXXXX. There is warmth somehow that comes through the seemingly boldface or frustratingly hidden lies. Beneath it all, human frailty not excluded, they meant well. And following along with the story, the turn of events provided satisfaction and smiles to how the two Manning's seem to have grown and matured in their relationship. <br /><br />You might say there's no obvious action drama or thrilling scenes in "Separate Lies," yet the intrigue is there and it will hold your attention. The deserving production efforts include cinematography by XXXX Pierce-Roberts (a veteran to the Merchant-Ivory films) and music by XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX, with mood and tone reminiscent of composer XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX (of filmmaker XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX's XXXXX XXXXXXXX, especially: Bleu 1993.) This is a British film you just might not want to miss. <br /><br />Emily XXXXXX (XXXX, the wife): Breaking the Waves 1996 debut; XXXXXX and Jackie 1998; The Luzhin Defence 2000; XXXXXXX XXXX 2001; Punch-Drunk Love, XXX XXXXXX, Equilibrium in 2002. <br /><br />XXX XXXXXXXXX (XXXXX, the husband): The Full Monty 1997; The Governess, XXXX XXXX (as villain) in 1998; In the Bedroom 2001, Normal (HBO cable movie) 2003, XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX of the Spotless Mind 2004, recently as XXXXXX XXXXX in: The Exorcism of XXXXX XXXX 2005 opposite XXXXX XXXXXX. <br /><br />XXXXXX XXXXXXX (XXXX): He is simply delightful in "My Best Friend's Wedding" 1997 opposite XXXXX XXXXXXX and marvelous in "An Ideal Husband" 1999 d: XXXXXX XXXXXX, an XXXXX XXXXX play.
