I thought this was movie was great, XXXXXXX XXXXXX and XXXXXXX XXXXXX have great chemistry in this movie. XXXXXXX XXXXXX's character plays a women who has fallen head over heals in love with XXXXXXX XXXXXX's character. They end up getting married and everything seems perfect except XXXXXXX XXXXXX wants a baby more than anything, however she has a hard time trying to conceive. XXXXXXX XXXXXX will do anything to make her happy, and will go to extreme measures to make her happy. I thought the acting was great in this movie, and it keeps you guessing. It shows how naive one can be when they have fallen in love. XXXXXXX XXXXXX is a good actress in this, and I wonder why she never made it further in her career. XXXXXXX XXXXXX is very impressive as the deceiving husband, and plays the evil part very well. I wonder why certain actors make it and certain ones don't. All and all a great movie that I would recommend.
