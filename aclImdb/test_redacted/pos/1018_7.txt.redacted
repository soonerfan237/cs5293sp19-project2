"Are You in the House Alone?" belongs to the pre-cable TV days when the networks were eager to offer an alternative to popular TV shows. It is well-made thriller with a talented cast and credible situations. XXXXXXXX XXXXXX plays a High School student who gets a series of threatening letters. Everyone seems to think that it is nothing more than a prank but XXXXXX is really scared. XXXX XXXX and XXXXXX XXXXXX play XXXXXX's parents, XXXXX XXXXXXXX (XXXX's sister) is the High School Principal and XXXXXX XXXXX has one of his earliest roles as a cocky rich kid. It's a competent chiller with a still relevant social message. XXXXXX is lovely - if you are 30 or older, you will remember that she was very popular among youngsters. XXXXXX XXXXXX, who I usually don't like, gives a truly moving performance. Nice little film.
