XXX XXXXXXX entry into a European film series is one of his two or three best efforts to date, and, lucklily, one of the few available on DVD. At only 63 minutes running time, my only quibble would be with XXXXXXX I always leave wanting more, but never so much as this time. XXXXXX XXXXXXX is astonishing as XXXXX. PJ Harvey is beautiful and interesting as XXXXXXXXX, but the high point for me was XXXXXX XXX XXXX (XXXXX XXXX) as Satan. XXXXXXX gives him excellent dialogue and a chance to use his resounding voice to full effect. Look for three scenes in which a microphone awaits him, as if a poetry slam is about to be won by the devil. I have read other comments on this film and had to add mine because there is not enough praise going around. If you like XXXXX XXXX, XXXXXX XXXXXXX in anything (Opposite of Sex), and/or very clever comedies based on biblical ideas, get this as quickly as possible.
