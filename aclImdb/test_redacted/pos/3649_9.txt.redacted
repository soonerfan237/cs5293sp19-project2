This is one of those Tweety and Sylvester cartoons that made this legendary pair second only to XXXX Bunny in terms of Looney Tunes popularity.<br /><br />Besides having all of the stock situations for this duo (Sylvester feeding out of garbage cans, the "I tawt I taw a putty tat" line, etc.), XXXXXX's S.O.S also stars Granny, who is one of those types of supporting characters that these Warner Bros. classics had in abundance to enrich the color and flavor of them. This time out the cat and bird are aboard an ocean liner and the gags that are extracted from this situation are creative and lively.<br /><br />What a day that was in cartoon history when XXXX Freleng decided to pair his Sylvester with the departed Robert Clampett's little yellow bird.
