The XXXX Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the XXXX Kersey of the original film . If you remember the 1974 film then you will remember XXXXXX was a " Conchie " during the Korean war and that he was physically sick after he committed his first execution . Ten years later XXXXXX seems to have learned unarmed combat and how to handle anti tank weapons in his spare time . But I`ll overlook that gaffe because DW3 is the best of the sequels , lowlife scum bags get shot dead , burned alive , their teeth smashed , and thrown to their deaths by middle aged housewives armed with sweeping brushes . Yeah I know the gang members are multi ethnic and for that they deserve some credit but even if they`re not racist they`re still murdering scum who deserve all they get from Kersey and the innocent citizens . Who needs Mayor Rudy when you`ve got XXXX Kersey , an anti tank rocket and a bunch of old age pensioners to reclaim the streets from the criminal creeps . XXXX Kersey I salute you sir
