After 2 years of using this site for movie reviews, I finally registered with IMDB just so I could give XXXXXXXX a "10." The show's writers, cast and crew have proven themselves the unambiguous masters of the science fiction genre. Even those who do not normally appreciate sci-fi should be encouraged to give this exceptional series a chance!<br /><br />XXXXXXXX's virtues are simply too numerous to list, but one of them stands out above all; the quality of the writing is amazing. I haven't heard dialogue this good since "XXXXX's 7." In fact, XXXXXXXX feels a lot like a "Blake's 7" with good special effects and a bit more romance.<br /><br />Everyone, enjoy!
