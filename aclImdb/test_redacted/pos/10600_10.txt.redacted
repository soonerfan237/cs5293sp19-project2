One word for it. Hilarious. I haven't watched at movie like this in a long time. At points in the movie, I totally forgot it was a movie, I just felt like I was back watching XXXX XX XXX, or even watching say, my own friend going through something like this. It was realistic and I liked how XXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXXXXX and the rest of the guys didn't try to hard too actually act. They, to me, were just acting like their famous idiot selves. There were a few scenes that I adored more than others, like XXXX in the shower, holy, I laughed so hard. He honestly was probably my favourite character besides XXX's. He really, in my opinion, made the movie just a bit more hilarious. It's basically a must see for any fans of the CKY crew:]
