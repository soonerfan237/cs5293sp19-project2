I first saw this film in the mid 60's when I was a teenager, and it moved me so much, in fact the end scene where XXX XXXXX hears of XXXX's death, and then rushes to the hill in disbelief, where you then hear XXXX's voice saying "Give XX XXXX XXXX", and then the image of him disappears, the butterfly with it's superstitious meaning, the music, the shattered emotions of Love of XXX XXXXX, just left me sobbing my heart out. I was outwardly crying bitterly, my mother and sister looked up and were shocked at my reaction. I just left the room to be on my own. Fortunately I do not react like that any more BUT I always cry at the end. I love everything about the film, the music mostly, the costumes of XXX XXXXX, and location. The beauty of XXXXXXXX XXXXX and the handsome XXXXXXX XXXXXX, they were both at their best. I have the VHS and DVD of this wonderful movie. I also have two versions of the Music & XXXXXX by XXXXXX XXXXXX and XXXXX XXXX. I also have the book A Many Splendored Thing by XXX XXXXX. I recommend this film 100%
