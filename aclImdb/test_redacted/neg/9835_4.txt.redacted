The Girl in Lovers Lane is one strange little low-budget film. On its surface, the movie tells the story of a tough drifter named Bix (XXXXX Halsey) who spends his time looking out for a young kid named Danny (Lowell Brown) and the girl, Carrie (Joyce Meadows), that Bix meets who would like to look out for him. Nothing overly interesting happens (Bix goes out with XXXXXX, Bix gets Danny out of trouble, XXXXXX's father drinks a lot, etc.) until about 10 minutes to go in the movie when XXXXXX is murdered. Her father blames XXX, pulls him out of a jail cell, and just about beats him to death. Now their roles are reversed and XXXXX has to save Bix.<br /><br />Until I read the reviews on IMDb, I thought that maybe it was just me reading more into Bix and XXXXX's relationship than was really there, but I see now that I'm not alone. It was quite obvious to me early on that Bix and XXXXX had more of a relationship than you usually see in a movie from 1959. The homosexual nature of their relationship, while never openly expressed, is still quite obvious. Their living and sleeping arrangements, XXX's reaction to finding Danny in bed with a prostitute, XXX's inability to commit to Carrie, and that phone call at the end when Danny tells his parents he's "brining home a friend are a few examples of moments that lead to the inevitable conclusion that there's more to their relationship than initially meets the eye. I'm sure they exist, but I can't think of any movies I've seen from the 50s that scream homosexual quite as loudly as this one.<br /><br />As for the movie, I don't know any other way to put this Â– it's boring. As I wrote earlier, nothing much at all happens for 90% of the run time. The characters are dull and the actors aren't good enough to give The Girl in Lovers Lane much of a spark. The lone exception is XXXX Elam. His crazy XXXXX is the one character interesting enough to be worth watching. XXXX had creepy down pat! But I guess the biggest problem I had with the movie was with character motivation and logic. Carrie is killed and Bix is immediately blamed? What about crazy Jesse who has been stalking XXXXXX for probably her whole life? Anyone think to ask XXXXX where he was that night? Her father has seen him bother XXXXXX at the diner, yet he never considers that the leering Jesse might have something to do with his daughter's death? Not a lot of logic there. And what about XXXXX's confession? Danny grabs XXXXX by the lapel and this is all it takes to force a confession out of XXXXX? Real tough guy, huh? Why would he confess so easily? And after he confesses, no one thinks to grab him? It's awfully nice of XXXXX just to stay put and not run off. In any other reality, he would have never spilled his guts and would have run like a rabbit if he had been fingered for the murder. The fact that The Girl in Lovers Lane asks me to accept these ridiculous actions on the part of the characters is something I'm not willing to do. Overall, I'm giving The Girl in Lovers Lane a 4/10.
