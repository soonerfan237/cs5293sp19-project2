Another XXXXXX Welch Classic! This Picture hit the theaters November 10 1969 starring XXXXXX Welch as Michele, James Stacey as Joe and Luke Askew as Alan Morris. Nikki is on her way to meet with her girl friends XXXXXXX and Jackie. While on her way there, she runs into her ex husband who wants a second chance. Nikki walk away from him goes to the table where she sees XXXXXXX and Jackie. XXXX approaches her again and she starts to walk away when XXXX shoots her in the back. Nikki is taken to the hospital while XXXXXXX and Jackie go to the police station. XXXXXXX goes to the hospital where she meets up with Jackie only to find that Nikki died. XXXX then goes after Jackie who he hits with a car and then tries to run Michele down. XXXXXXX jumps into her car and heads for Los Angeles. When she gets there, she calls XXXXX her boss in Las Vegas to let him know that she was all right. Lloyd tells her to go to the club called the losers to see XXXX about a job. However, there's one problem! The bartender has a drug problem and XXXX knows it so XXXX and the bartender have a little talk. Back in Los Angeles XXXXXXX not only gets a job as a dancer with Jeri but also hooks up with Jeri bouncer Joe. Now some thoughts on this picture! This picture was far better then XXXXXX last, and this one had nonstop action. XXXX Askew did a fine job of playing Nikki ex husband. He was your typical murder with the look that goes with it. As for XXXXXX Welch performance, the only word that comes to mine is fantastic. She was awesome in this movie and her beauty stood out and shined like never before. The outfit that she wore on stage to dance was breathtaking. In fact, all the outfits she wore in this movie were breathtaking. Of course, it doesn't matter what XXXXXX had on because she looks good in everything or nothing. I give this movie 10 weasel stars for two reasons. The first and by far is XXXXXX Welch who's the leading actress and deserves 10 stars. The second reason is that this movie was wall-to-wall excitement from beginning to end.
