"XXXX XXXXX" is my favorite XXXXXX XXXXX movie, though he has made many great ones including "Salvador", "JFK", "Natural Born Killers" and "Platoon". But I like the intimacy of "XXXX XXXXX", a cinematic expansion of XXXX XXXXXXXX's searing stage play that was based on a real life account of a Dallas talk show host. Working with ace cinematographer XXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX, XXXXX turns what could have been a very set-bound exercise into a visually arresting ideological battle that presents a radio station as an arena of war. Bogosian is devastating as tortured on-air spouter of abuse XXXXX XXXXXXXXX and conveys the conflicted, destructive nature of his character with conviction and a generous dose of self-loathing. XXXX Baldwin, as his Alpha male boss, strikes the perfect note as a man driven nuts by a guy whose monstrousness he helped nurture. XXXXX Greene is fantastic as XXXXX's sweet ex-wife who ends up becoming another target of his vicious personal vitriol. XXXXX and Bogosian fill every frame with interest and every line of dialog with sweet poison and cutting ambiguity. XXXX C. McGinley, as XXXXX's long-suffering screener/technical producer XXX, turns in a hilarious, sharp performance, as does the great XXXXXXX XXXXXXX. The film is a flawless, underrated masterpiece of superb writing, awesome acting and brutal, uncompromising direction. The XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX score is brilliant, too.
