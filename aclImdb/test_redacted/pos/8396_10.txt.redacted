My mother is as XXXX With The Wind as one can be. She has the collector's plates, the Rhett and XXXXXXXX Madame Alexander dolls, GWTW Christmas ornaments, even a GWTW cookbook! My sister and I had only seen bits and pieces of GWTW but we knew the whole plot by heart. On a whim, my sister bought this miniseries thinking my mother would like it and we had taken an interest in it after leafing through the novel a bit.<br /><br />Yesterday we decided to watch both Gone With The Wind and XXXXXXXX. We started GWTW at about 2:30 in the afternoon and ended it at 6:30. We started XXXXXXXX right after. My mother usually goes to bed at about 10:00, she wound up staying up until 1:30 with us to finish it! We were riveted! I like how the movie starts off at Melanie's funeral, right where XXXXXXXX left off saying, "I'll think about it tomorrow." XXXXXXXX doesn't stay in Georgia for long, she runs off to Charleston in her quest to win him back. Rhett is not happy when he finds XXXXXXXX in his home so he leaves for the family's plantation. XXXXXXXX, being XXXXXXXX, follows him and they finally agree to put aside their quarrels for a time in order to keep the gossip at bay. XXXXX starts to enjoy her company again and takes her out on his boat. A storm comes up and they sink. He helps her swim to the shore of some island. Terrified that she has died, XXXXX is anxious until she awakes. When she does they both get swept up in the moment and make love. Scarlett wakes up the next day back in Charleston but XXXXX has gone and writes that he thinks it best if they never see each other again.<br /><br />Scarlett is heartbroken and when she is so she does some stupid things, in this case she is seen by Anne Hampton going up into a hotel room alone with Ashley. Nothing happens, but her reputation is stained so XXXXXXXX goes to Savannah with her two spinster aunts. She soon discovers that she is pregnant and decides to wait for the right time to tell XXXXX. While in Savannah she meets many of her O'Hara relatives and grows to like one cousin in particular a Father Colum. She soon gets her divorce notice from XXXXX and then decides she will never tell him about her baby just to spite him. XXXXXXX Scarlett.<br /><br />She decides to go to Ireland to make sure Rhett can never discover her condition. She meets many more relatives and buys a beautiful ancestral home XXXXXXXXX. Through out this time, XXXXX is courting Anne. It is on Halloween when XXXXXXXX gets the notice that Rhett has remarried, she goes into labor that night.<br /><br />The movie skips to a year later and XXXXXXXX is very happy with her beautiful daughter Kat. She is being pursued by XXXX Richard Fenton who is really an evil man, forcing a young girl named Mary Boyle to sleep with him. Scarlett meets XXXXX and Anne again at a horse fair. After a riding accident, XXXXXXXX has a conversation with Anne and learns that she and Rhett are to have a baby. Heartbroken again, XXXXXXXX leaves and goes to Dublin with Fenton. There she cultivates a relationship with him, like I said, she does stupid things when she is heartbroken.<br /><br />Mary Boyle has discovered she is pregnant and goes to Colum for help. The priest urges XXXXXX to help the girl and XXXXXX murders him after Colum threatens to tell Scarlett. Fenton convinces XXXXXXXX to go to London with him to escape her grief over Colum's death. XXXX asks to go with her. Back in Charleston, XXXX has died of Yellow Fever. It is made clear that she never bore XXXXX a child.<br /><br />In London, Scarlett sees Fenton's true colors after he hurts her when she isn't in the mood the sleep with him. Fenton rapes her after she tells him she never wants to see him again. She falls unconscious after and when she wakes up XXXXXX has been stabbed to death. Scarlett is charged with his murder.<br /><br />XXXXX hears about it and rushes off to England with Sally in tow. Fearful of the gallows, XXXXXXXX has no choice but to tell Rhett about their daughter. Rhett is furious at her for keeping such a secret but stays to help her. XXXX Boyle, the real killer, can't be found. Scarlett is found guilty but XXXX finally arrives to declare her innocence. After promising to help XXXX, Scarlett leaves with Rhett for Ireland because as he says, "It's time I became acquainted with my daughter." The scene where he sees XXX for the first time is absolutely beautiful. In Ireland, XXXXX sees how much Scarlett has changed and the two finally reconcile completely and admit they still love each other deeply.<br /><br />After seeing GWTW, I will say that yes, Vivian Leigh was a better Scarlett, but I liked the character of Scarlett in this film than in the first. The reason being that in GWTW, you don't know why you like XXXXXXXX. She's so cruel to XXXXX and haughty and spoiled, but you like her lively spirit. In Scarlett, you see how much she has changed. Oh she is still in the lap of luxury, but she's not haughty anymore. You see how she becomes a true mother to XXX and a generous person to the poor people of Ireland. XXXXXX Whalley does and excellent job at playing this new side of Scarlett. XXXXXXX Dalton is not Clark Gable, but at times you swear that you can see original Rhett in him.<br /><br />If you just sit back and not compare Joanne Whalley and XXXXXXX Dalton with Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable, you will most certainly enjoy this movie. It's a chance to compare the Scarlett of yesterday, the one she becomes after "tomorrow".
