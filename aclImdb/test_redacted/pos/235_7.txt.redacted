Though I strongly feel that SITR is the best XXXX Kelly movie, but this a pretty good one. I liked the music and the dancing and the ending on how XXXX got the girl. My favorite part though without a doubt is XXXX's dance with his alter ego. I love watching two Gene XXXXX's for the price of one. It shows what talent XXX Kelly really was. It is a movie that I think that everyone should watch at least once in their life time. So you have not seen it go out and find to watch it today! I'm sure that everyone out there has a Gene Kelly friend that has this movie in their collection. So go over to their house and pop some popcorn and enjoy!
