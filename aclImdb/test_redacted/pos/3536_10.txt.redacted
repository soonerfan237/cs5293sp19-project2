XXXXXXX was compulsive viewing from start to finish. The story centred on apparently random murders of men in London in various gruesome ways. DCI Red Metcalfe (XXX Stott)has to find the truth which, to his surprise, is a little closer to home than he might think.<br /><br />Gripping drama and XXX Stott was brilliant. Hopefully we have not seen the last of DCI Red Metcalfe.
