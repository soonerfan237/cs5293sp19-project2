XXX XXXXXXX in his prime stars as XXXXX XXXXX, a mental asylum escapee who poses as his own shrink to travel out to XX XX XXXX and host a popular radio talk show while the regular host (XXXXXX XXXXXX in his snarling prime) takes a vacation. Along the way, XXXXXXX hooks up with XXXXXX XXXXXXX, a fellow nutjob, and the rest is sheer hilarity. XXXXXXX and XXXXXXX play off very well off one another. XXXXXXX's stunning real-life wife, XXXXX XXXXX, is along for the ride as yet another shrink. The ending feels a bit rushed and contrived, which is the only thing that keeps me from giving this film my top rating, an 8. A lost '80s gem.
