When the noble Hanabusa clan is decimated by the usurping XXXXXXXXXX clan, loyal retainer XXXXXXX (XXX XXXXXXXX) escapes with his lord's eight year old son, Tadafumi, and his daughter, XXXXXX. They are sheltered by the priestess Shinobu (XXXXX XXXXXXXXX), who serves the Hanabusa clan's god, XXXXX, a vengeful spirit imprisoned in the giant stature carved into the side of a local mountain. Ten years later, XXXXXXX and Tadafumi (XXXXXXXXX XXXXXX) seek vengeance against XXXX XXXXXXXXXX (Yutaro Gomi), but are captured in the attempt, and sentenced to die. Priestess Shinobu, desperately attempting to save her master, threatens XXXXXXXXXX with the god's displeasure, only to be slashed to death for her efforts. XXXXXXXXXX, a vain, cruel, narrow man, orders XXXXX's statue to be destroyed, in order to crush any last vestiges of hope among the remaining Hanabusa loyalists. But the god XXXXX, who hitherto has been implacably silent, has other ideas...<br /><br />XXXXXXXX is an enthralling, timeless, deeply moving fairy tale. Lavishly produced on a respectable budget, it is a film about values: the values of nobility, of justice, of decency, of loyalty, of self sacrifice, and of love. It is about hierarchy, and rule, and of the consequences of failing to live up to the responsibility that rule entails. These are things that are not talked about much in our demotic times, except by scribbling toads like XXXXXXX XXXXXX, but are nonetheless relevant, and XXXXXXXX shows us why. <br /><br />XXXXXXXX is a perfect example of why Japanese cinema is so glorious. The values listed above have palpable relevance for those involved in this film, as they do for many a Japanese filmmaker. There is no lip service, no condescension, no irony here. Instead, there is an authentic effort to conjure a world where these values can once again have life, and to show what happens when they fall into abeyance. Just compare XXXXXXXX, or the Lone Wolf and Cub series, or any Kurosawa film to the egregious XXXXXXXXX's nihilistic XXXX XXXX b*llshit, to see what I mean.<br /><br />In a film whose contributing talent is so uniformly excellent, I would merely like to point out master XXXXX XXXXXXX's majestic score, the talent and beauty of actors XXX XXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXX XXXXXX, and XXXX XXXXXX; and the stunning portrayal by XXXXX XXXXXXXXX. Her death scene is one of the most moving and meaningful that I have ever witnessed.
