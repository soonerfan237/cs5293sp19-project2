DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING (XXXXX XXXXX - Italy 1972).<br /><br />Definitely a prime candidate for the most insane movie title ever conceived and that's quite an achievement in giallo-land. Originally, the film was titled even more absurdly, "Don't Torture XXXXXX XXXX", literally translated from its Italian title. A small XXXXXX XXXX figure features briefly as a toy, but hardly enough to render a title like this, but, apparently, it was changed in fear of legal ramifications by Disney. I railed quite a bit against XXXXX's earlier LIZARD IN A WOMAN'S SKIN (1971), but here all the right ingredients are present. A surprisingly effective mystery, a good cast and imaginatively shot against an unusual rural setting. Everything just clicks. I think it's justly hailed as one of the director's most accomplished achievements.<br /><br />The story is set against the backdrop of a small mountain-side town in XXXXXX, where someone is killing young teenage boys. Among the suspects, the most obvious one is a young woman, Maciara (XXXXXXXX XXXXXX), a self-proclaimed witch who is seen suspiciously unearthing the skeleton of a baby and sticking pins into way effigies. Guiseppe, the village idiot is under suspicion as well, since he made a feeble attempt to profit from the disappearance of one of the boys and walked right into their trap. By the time a quick-witted newshound (XXXXX XXXXXX) arrives from XXXXX to cover the murders, he immediately begins to question the authorities' assumptions, when he meets two other potential suspects: XXX XXXXXXX, the local priest (XXXX XXXXX) with a high-minded attitude, and Patrizia (XXXXXXX XXXXXXX), a bored young woman from the city with a troubled past of drug offense, who also fancies having sexual relations with the young boys in town. Talk about your prime red herring.<br /><br />XXXXX nicely contrasts modernity and tradition with the newly constructed elevated highway meandering through the Sicilian hills, past old towns where life is still firmly rooted in tradition and superstition. One could debate about the film's political stance as The North versus The South, or as commentary on small-town virtues - society's conventions in general - that are all too often dangerously close to tipping over into moral disintegration, chaos and - ultimately - self-justice by the populace. The film has often been lambasted because of its anti-catholic tone, but it's hardly an important element here, except for obvious plot-related reasons, which would be giving away too much. It's actually rather tame compared to a film like XXXX XXXXX's DON'T DELIVER US FROM EVIL (1971). Probably, the film's rather unflattering portrayal of small-town Sicilian values (when another boy is killed, the local populace are depicted as a retarded lynch-mob) might be cause for some offense in XXXXXX, but - considering XXXXXX's problematic relation with the rest of Italy - hardly problematic for other Italians, I would think. The film vanquished into obscurity far too quickly to have much impact anyway.<br /><br />When talking XXXXX, the amount of gore is usually a prime subject for discussion. Although eyes-gouging scenes are lacking, the film does contain two very graphic scenes. In the gross-out finale, the killer falls of a cliff, smashing his face along the rocks on the way down with gruesome results (albeit, not very realistic). And the chain-whipping sequence with XXXXXXXX XXXXXX in the graveyard shows XXXXX's penchant for sadistic violence and typically, he's not holding back at graphically showing what most film-makers would merely hint at. Surely, one of the most horrifying scenes in XXXXX's repertoire. <br /><br />Above all, this is a taut, well-written, effective little mystery, nicely lensed by XXXXX, with an impressive cast of genre-regulars like XXXXXXX XXXXXXX, XXXX XXXXX (not very convincing as a priest), XXXXX XXXXXX and XXXXXXXX XXXXXX (mouth-foamingly crazy as the town's witch).<br /><br />XXXXXX XXXXXXX --- 8/10
