My husband received DVD of OBWAT for XXXXXXXXX and it was the best gift we received! We watch it every time we need to laugh and so far we have viewed it 12 times!The scenery in this movie is beautiful and the music is outstanding!We also purchased the soundtrack and we play it in our vehicles and at home when ever we need a pick me up and that too is daily!If anyone needs a suggestion for a good gift for movie lovers this movie is it!The characters are hilarious , charming , and their facial expressions are too funny to describe!I have always been a fan of XXXXXX XXXXXXX but now I am also a fan of XXX XXXXX XXXXXX(Delmar ) and XXXX XXXXXXXX (Pete)and am now looking for them in other movies! You gotta see this movie!!!
