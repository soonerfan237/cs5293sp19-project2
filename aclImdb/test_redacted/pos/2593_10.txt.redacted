In one of the many XXXX Bunny-XXXXX Duck cartoons, XXXXX XXXX is out hunting, and XXXXX tries to get him to shoot XXXX. Needless to say, XXXX has his own agenda. Moreover, "Rabbit Seasoning" makes interesting use of word order and pronouns (warning: it just might hilariously and royally mess up your speech).<br /><br />I think that probably my favorite aspect of this cartoon is the costumes worn by XXXX and XXXXX. One of them seems like it would have been risqu√© for 1952 (especially in a cartoon), but they pull it off perfectly, as they always did. All in all, this just goes to show what geniuses the people behind these cartoons were.
