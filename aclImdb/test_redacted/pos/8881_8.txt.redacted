A picture starring XXXXX Devito and Billy Crystal. They are both famous actors, and in this charming comedy entails them trying to murder each other's pet peeve. XXXXX Crystal's pet peeve being his ex wife who stole his book and put her name on it, and Danny Devito's pet peeve being his malignant mother. XXXXX Crystal is an author and a teacher apparently and Danny Devito is one of his students. This comedy classic is very entertaining and for all ages.<br /><br />XXXXX Devito seems to act like a child in this movie because of his evil mother who keeps putting him down all the time. She says things like "You have no friends!" and when XXXXX Crystal fell down, she said "Burry him before he stinks up the basement!". She puts down XXXXX also by calling him "Lard ass!" and other things just to make him angry.
