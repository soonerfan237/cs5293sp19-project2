But not too hip. And not too wisecracking. "XXXXX Kiss" nails the new noir thing just right. Great pacing and a nuanced score round out a twisty tale filled with sex, betrayal and sure-fire one liners. Inspiring work all around. Kudos in partcular to HalHolbrook (his best work ever), XXX Bellows (Ally Mc-what?) and XXXXX Gugino (the best famme fatale in ages... smart, funny and ultra HOT)... I give this a 9 (out of 10) and that's because 10 should be reserved for like, XXXXXXXX Bogart and Coen Bros movies.
