Never mind if 'National XXXXXX (1944)' is a bit hackneyed and occasionally unconvincing, XXXXXXXX XXXXX's equestrian fable is an endearing and very likable story with a good moral. After achieving modest success through her appearance in 'Lassie Come Home (1943),' young XXXXXXXXX XXXXXX, age 12, landed her first leading role as XXXXXX XXXXX, a passionate schoolgirl with an obsession for horses. XXXXXX filmed in California, the story - adapted from a novel by XXXX XXXXXXX - is set in a small township on the English countryside, and full advantage is taken of the Technicolor photography to present the vibrant and handsome landscapes of blue skies and green shrubs. XXXXXX XXXXXX takes top billing as XX XXXXXX, a misguided ex-jockey with devious intentions, whose relationship with young XXXXXX reawakens his sense of dignity and opens a new, optimistic chapter in his life. XXXXXX he noticeably struggles in one sequence, when he must confess the traumatic experience that led to his fear of horses, XXXXXX is enjoyable as the surly but passionate young man who must prove his worth.<br /><br />It is perhaps a good thing that XXXXXXXXX XXXXXX had those entrancing violet eyes, because her acting abilities, at this young age, were rather limited. Her more emotional sequences, in which she displays courage and integrity in the face of adversity, strike one as being rather hollow, and the touchingly-naive notion that simply "believing" will accomplish everything is one that has since been repeated ad nauseam by practically every unmemorable inspirational sporting film ever made. Nevertheless, XXXXXX is bright-eyed and enthusiastic, and she works well with XXXXXX XXXXXX, who was no stranger to being a child-star. XXXX Revere plays a very important role as XXXXXX's mother, once a famous athlete, who not only swam the English Channel but was lovingly-trained by none other than XX XXXXXX's own father. I liked that XX was not told about this until the film's final seconds, with Mrs. XXXXX correctly deciding that the young man would first need to develop his own sense of decency, rather than exploiting the memory of his late father for financial gain, as he would undoubtedly have done at the film's beginning.<br /><br />The film reaches its climax at the Grand National Sweepstakes, where XXXXXX has, at the last moment, decided to ride her own horse, the Pi, in the world-famous competition. Under the guise of a Latvian male, she goes on, as expected, to win the race, but is later disqualified - either because she's a girl, or because she tumbled from the horse before she was allowed to dismount (what a stupid rule!). This extended race sequence is exceedingly well-done, effectively capturing the nervous tension of those nerve-racking pre-race seconds, and the confusion of the event that places us in the same position as XXXXXX's character, stranded behind tall spectators and waiting anxiously for somebody to provide an accurate update. It doesn't really matter that we know it's a stunt double doing most of the difficult riding - in several scenes, we can clearly see a creepy-looking man in a wig - but the positive message remains the same. I'll wager that 'National XXXXXX' has nurtured the imaginations of millions of young girls over the last sixty years, and it's power to inspire has decreased little with time.
