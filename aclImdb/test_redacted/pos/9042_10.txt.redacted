This is easily the best cinematic version of XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX's fiction that I've ever seen, and I've seen several of the most prominent ones. Filmed in XXXXXXXX's hometown of Oxford, Mississippi, it really captures the feeling of XXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXX. Intruder in the Dust is not one of XXXXXXXX's best novel, but, even if it is a clich√© to say this, it would be the crown jewel in any one else's career. It beats XXXXXX XXX's good but simplistic To Kill a Mockingbird fifty feet into the ground (I read that one in ninth grade, and that's exactly where it belongs). Two of XXXXXXXX's most prominent characters play major parts in the film, XXXXX XXXXXXX and XXXXX XXXXXXXXX. XXXXXXX is probably the single most common character in all of XXXXXXXX's fiction. He's a lawyer and he works easily as a narrator, because, unlike many of his other characters, XXXXXXX is a man of logic, not emotion (at least when he's older). XXXXX XXXXXXXXX may be the most prominent of all of XXXXXXXX's black characters (he plays a major part in one of XXXXXXXX's out-and-out masterpieces, XX XXXX, Moses); unlike all of the other black folks in Yoknapatawpha, he refuses to bow down to any white man. He has pride, and many in the white population find that an execrable quality in a black man. One day, XXXXX is found standing over a dead white man with a recently-fired pistol in his possession. Most of XXXXXXXXX and the surrounding areas don't see the need for a trial, and everyone's pretty sure that XXXXXXXXX will be lynched before the evening's over, or at least the next day, as the murder and arrest occurred on a Sunday. XXXXXXXXX, on the other hand, declares his innocence and tries to get XXXXXXX to help him. XXXXXXX refuses; the case seems open and shut. But his young nephew, XXXXX XXXXXXXX, because XXXXX had helped him in the past, is willing to help him now.<br /><br />As far as I know, no Hollywood film of this period deals with racism as overtly as this one. Hollywood films rarely persecute the black population, but instead prefer to relegate them to servant roles. If you're an African American actor, you might as well give up and accept that role as either the mammy, the maid, the servant, or the porter, because that's the only way you'll work. In Intruder in the Dust, there is to be found one of the most memorable non-porter roles a black actor ever had, XXXXX XXXXXXXXX. And XXXXXXXXX, as I described above, is no stereotypical character, and might have been hard for audiences to accept. Even today, black characters are usually simple, magical, and kind. The recent arthouse hit XXX from Heaven is a great example of that. XXXXXXXXX is kind of a jerk, and he's very stubborn. Although he's perhaps a little less so here than he is in the novel, he's not any kind of stereotype. He's a complex human being. XXXXX XXXXXXXXX plays XXXXXXXXX extraordinarily well. I haven't seen the film in a while, but he also appears in XXXXXX XXXXXXX's 1955 film, XXXX XX XXXXXX, as well as the cinematic adaptation of XXXXXXXX's final novel, The Reivers.<br /><br />All the actors are great in the film. I should also praise quickly XXXXXX XXXXXX XXX, who has the great role of XXXXX XXXXXXXX. The novel takes place from his point of view, and he is the conventional hero of the picture. Jarman is quite an actor; he captures the character (who also appears elsewhere in XXXXXXXX's fiction, narrating, for example, events that happened a decade or more before he was born in the 1957 novel The Town) perfectly. He would appear in another great role the next year in the underrated XXXX XXXX film XXX XXXXXX. The only other film of Clarence Brown's that I've seen is National Velvet, quite a different picture than Intruder in the Dust. His job here is exceptional; I really have to credit him with capturing XXXXXXXX perfectly. Other famous XXXXXXXX adaptations are too melodramatic (The Long Hot Summer, filmed in 1958, which I really like despite that) or too cold (Tomorrow, filmed in 1972, which I do not like; that coldness is a complete misunderstanding of XXXXXXXX). The only other one that really does well according to its source material is XXXXXXX XXXX's great 1958 filming of Pylon (really a different sort of XXXXXXXX novel altogether), Tarnished Angels. 10/10.
