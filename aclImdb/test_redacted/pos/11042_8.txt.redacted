039: XXXX XXXXXXXX (1930) - released 2/21/1930; viewed 3/10/06 <br /><br />On October 24, 1929: XXXXX Thursday, the stock market crashes. Now the country and indeed the world will look to Hollywood for escape from the worldwide XXXXX Depression.<br /><br />BIRTHS: XXXX XXXXX, XXXX XXXXXX, XXXXXX XXXXXX, XXX XXXXXXX, XXXXXXX XXXXXXX, XXXXX XXXXXXX, XX XXXXX, XXXX XXXXX, XXX XX XXXXXX, XXXX Hackman.<br /><br />DOUG: At long last, our Odyssey resumes in earnest with XXXXX XXXXX's first sound film, a simple character study called XXXX XXXXXXXX. An excellent performance from Ms. XXXXX, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but XXXXXXX doesn't seem to be stocking them. How odd). One thing I noticed over and over was the way the Swedish accent sounds, like replacing the letter J with a Y sound. XXXX ends up being the only character I liked; I didn't really care for her estranged father or her would-be suitor. It looks like the sound-recording systems are getting better (nobody leaning in to talk into the mystery-can), but the camera still isn't moving. We'll be sure to watch for that to change as our odyssey continues.<br /><br />KEVIN: Our first film of the 1930's is the first sound film of silent starlet XXXXX XXXXX, XXXX XXXXXXXX. This is a very simple movie, with only about five different locations where we spend long stretches of the film's 89 minute running time, often with a static camera. It was great to see XXXXX XXXXXXXX in sound as well, and quite hilarious as what we hear is an endless chain of heartfelt yet inebriated slurs. I very much enjoyed XXXXX's performance, as she sustains the film through even the most meandering moments. I didn't really like XXXXXX XXXXXX or XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX, maybe because I wasn't sympathetic to either of them, so I was relieved and excited when XXXX finally stands up for herself and shows them that she doesn't "belong" to either her estranged father or her muscle-bound Irish boyfriend. It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter XXXXXXX XXXXXX hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.<br /><br />Last film viewed: Speedy (1928).
