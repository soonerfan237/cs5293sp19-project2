Perhaps the director was trying for another PIRATE (Good Garland and XXXXX musical) -- but this lame musical epoch falls flat. XXXXXXX and XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX voices do not blend well -- and their chemistry together lacks spark. The premise of XXXXXXX as a sweet guy who tries to impersonate his late "bandito" father is okay, but he seems awkward in the role. What's amazing and wonderful here, is how XXXXXXX can take a rather insipid song and make it seem special -- his phrasing and eloquence as a singer make you want to hear it again. When XXXXXXX sings the same songs it's hard to believe she's not singing something entirely different and not nearly as interesting. She has her big moment with "Love Is Where You Find It" which suits her perfectly and shows off her abilities. The photography is lucious and both stars look appealing as do the costumes and sets. Co-stars XXXXXXX XXXXXXX and J. XXXXXXX XXXX put lots of energy into making the impossible work. Aside from XXXXXXX's singing there is a strange menage-a-tois dance with XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX, XXX XXXXXXXX and XXX XXXXXX. It's fascinating and weird. Montalban and XXXXXXXX were a wonderful dancing team and this number is a real oddity.
