This is a good enough movie and you probably won't be disappointed, but it again has XXX Scheider, right after he did "French Connection", playing a cop with the name 'Buddy'. They also use the same too-memorable wheelman from "XXXXXXX". At first you'll think you've seen the car chase before if you have his face still in your memory. The car chase is a great one, but as in many car movie scenes, it has some technical and editing errors. Check "XXXXXX on a Chain" and "French Connection II" for some other good, long, intense chases.
