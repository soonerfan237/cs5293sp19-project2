If Western Union isn't exactly the real story of the construction of the Transcontinental Telegraph, it certainly does capture the spirit and dedication of the people involved with the project.<br /><br />Dean XXXXXX is the man in charge and one fine day he's thrown from a horse and sustains some fractured ribs. An outlaw on the run, XXXXXXXX XXXXX, finds XXXXXX and is ready to steal his horse, but changes his mind and brings XXXXXX to help. Later on he's hired by Western Union and works for XXXXXX.<br /><br />XXXXXX also hires a young easterner played by XXXXXX XXXXX who's an engineer. Young is doing one of his few loan out films away from MGM for 20th Century Fox. Both Young and XXXXX become friends, but rivals for XXXXXX's sister XXXXXXXX Gilmore.<br /><br />Western Union has plenty of action, enough to satisfy any western fans. The telegraph crew has to deal with outlaws, Indians, and your garden variety labor troubles.<br /><br />Slim Summerville as the timid cook and XXXXXX XXXXXXX as the frontier character assigned to guard him have some of the funniest scenes. They both provide some good comic relief. <br /><br />Fritz XXXX got good performances from his cast and kept the film moving briskly along. Western Union is solid western entertainment.
