Considering it's basically low-budget cast, this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock pioneer XXXXX Holly. XXXX Busey stars as Holly, who was one of the first to use an electric guitar for pretty much all his music. Backed up by his Crickets, XXXXX had a string of hits and became a bona fide star before his death in a plane crash along with Richie Valens and The Big Bopper. The film follows his rise to stardom, marriage to his sweetheart and eventual death. I like this film and believe that you will too. XXXXXXX Martin Smith also does a great job in this film.
