I pretty much liked every character on this show from the start except XXXX herself. She comes off as an holier than thou type and quite frankly a big Bully. And that stinks because she is in every scene and every episode. In the later seasons XXX becomes unlikeable too,like a spoof of his former self. and Kyra walks around sneering and being miserable.The first 3 to 4 seasons are pretty good if you overlook XXXX. Towards the end its pretty bleak.. In basically every episode XXXXXXX jean Is walking around being dumb,Reba is being mean to her,but poor Ole XXXXXXX jean desperately wants Reba to like her which results in Barabara jean telling Reba how awesome she is in every episode. I think it is pretty clear to see XXXX has self esteem issues and wants to be seen as this all forgiving saint. Its really a shame too because other than her the show had such potential.
