This is an engrossing woman's drama that men can enjoy. The plot follows a young woman (Hope Lange) who goes to work for a publisher after college. We can forgive her jump in position from secretary to editor (hey, it's Hollywood) and a few other flaws. Here is one of the few films in which once big time producer XXXXXX Evans (here, beautifully depicting a rat with women) appears. It also features a mature XXXX Crawford and terrific supporting cast. Check it out.
