I have seen a few of XXXX Carpenter's movies on Showtime, Pay Per View and video/DVD and I enjoyed most of these films especially with a few beers, (Carpenter knows how to entertain)"EDDIE MONROE" and "MURDERED INNOCENCE" are my favorites. I recently Viewed a Promo DVD of "EDDIE MONROE" and everything from the cast to the storyline and directing all worked smoothly. (XXXX Brown's Music Score was sensational.) I enjoyed seeing XXXXX Sivero ("Goodfellas", "New York, New York" and "The Wedding Singer"), he is an amazing and very underrated actor.But I especially liked the performance of Paul Vario who played Uncle Benny, I looked up his acting credits on the IMDb and I found out this was his first starring role. Where has this guy been! Give XXXX Carpenter credit for discovering Great New Talent, it's only a matter of time you'll be seeing this guy costarring with Pacino and DeNiro. As I mentioned XXXXXXXXX knows how to entertain and when your working with a limited budget it is amazing what XXXXXXXXX can Produce.(I read the VENT MAGAZINE interview and XXXXXXXXX has never made a movie for more than $400,000.00 dollars.) Before I watched "EDDIE MONROE" I saw "XXXXX Balboa" and "The Good Shepherd" both great films. "XXXXX Monroe" took me on a ride to a surprised ending because of a very good script, good performances from the entire cast(Craig Morris is a movie star waiting to happen and the lead Actress Jessica Tsunis was hot!) great Cinematography, XXXXXXXXX and Doug Brown's Music Score. As I stated I recently seen "XXXXX Balboa" and "The Good Shepherd", if I were to write a comment about those two movies I would be saying some of the same things I have stated about "EDDIE MONROE", the only thing those two very good films don't have in common with "Eddie Monroe", they didn't cost a few hundred grand. Great movie and I didn't even drink a beer.
