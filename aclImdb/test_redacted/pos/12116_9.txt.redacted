This was a great anime. True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than XXXXX XXXXXX, the problem that it was kinda long.<br /><br />Japanese movie star XXXXXXXX XXXXXX who played XXXX from Last XXXXXXX played the main character XXXX and it was directed by XXXXXXX who did XXXXXX XXXXXXX 999 and Metropolis.<br /><br />The anime has some good animation for an old anime, interesting characters like the main villain XXXXXX and XXXX XXXXXXX and of course lets not forget the beautiful musical scores in the film.<br /><br />All in all this movie is worth watching for fans of anime, animation in general, action, and XXXXXXX/Ninja flicks. Despite the lows in the film that didn't the film from being a great film to watch.<br /><br />Don't miss this film.
