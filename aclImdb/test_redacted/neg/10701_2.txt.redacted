This movie stunk. There is not much more to it. The final fight looked like XXXXXX taking on my grandmother, not some supernatural demon with the strength of ten men. I found the commercials more interesting. The plot twists and jokes could be seen coming a mile away. The only redeeming quality of this film was that it ended. Avoid this at all costs...unless you enjoy bad XXXXX Norris movies.
