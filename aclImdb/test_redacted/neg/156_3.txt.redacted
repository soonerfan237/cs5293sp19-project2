XXXX Bender's "The Tempest" is an adaption of Shakespeare's play "The Tempest". Bender transports the plot from medieval Italy to Mississippi during the time of the American civil war. He includes the slavery problem and the role of revenge in wartimes.<br /><br />Prospero, re-named XXXXXX Prosper is not the Duke of Milan but a landowner in Mississippi. He learns voodoo magic from the female slave XXXXX Azaleigh. He saves her son XXXXX, who thus accompanies him into his exile. The island is not situated on the sea but in a swamp near the banks of the Mississippi. There lives an Alligator hunter, a so-called "Gator-Man", who later tries to rape XXXXXXXX's daughter Miranda. During the time of the civil war, XXXXX wants to join the Union troops to help fighting against slavery. Prospero does not care about the war. He is only interested in his personal revenge on his brother XXXXXX. When XXXXXX and his bookkeeper Willi Gonzo (Gonzalo) try to cross the river, Prospero raises a storm. The Union soldier XXXXXXXXX gets lost in the swamp and finally comes to the island. He and Miranda fall in love with each other but XXXXXXXX won't accept that. Meanwhile, XXXXX transformed into a raven by Prospero, finds out that Antony has feigned to ally with the Union but plans to betray them. Antony and XXXXX meet Gator Man in the swamp and conspire with him against Prospero. They kidnap XXXXXXX and Ariel but Prospero freeze them and helps the Union defeat the Southern army. In the end XXXXX is free, Frederick and Miranda are bound to marry, Prospero returns to the plantation and Gator Man gets back the island.<br /><br />Peter Fonda represents Gideon Prosper powerfully and convincingly while the character of Antony stays rather flat. It was no bad idea to perform the Tempest before the background of the civil war but perhaps the director has risked too much. In some parts the story seems constructed or comical. XXXXX Man for example does just appear without any explanation. That it needs a kidnapping to bring Prospero to his mind and that he loses confidence in his power shows that XXXXXX tried to make Prospero more human but only made him a weak old man without his magic. Prospero's original authority and wisdom is not made clear.<br /><br />-------------End of Part 1----------------------------
