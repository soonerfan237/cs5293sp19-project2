The only reason I watched this movie a second time, was to learn the name of the "second banana" girl playing opposite XXXXX Holms. Her name is XXXXXX Coughlan. Never heard of her before. She is lovely. Captivating. With an animated face, and cute bod, she is highly watchable... She's got real, "Poisenality"... More than a passing vibe of XXXXX Kelly... with youthful exuberance. I think she is Irish in gene pool, (my favorite female DNA) so it makes some sense that she would resemble the most beautiful Irish American. The movie is unremarkable, XXXXX Holms is classic beauty in the flesh. But XXXXXX Coughlan is the one you follow with your eyes. In 1999 when this movie was made, she was around 25 years old, in her prime. This reminds me of another silly, worthless movie with the only redemption being the Pretty Girl in it. It was "XXXXXX Opportunites" with the first time I saw Jennifer Conoly. Or "XXXXXX II" the first time I saw Michelle Pfeiffer.
