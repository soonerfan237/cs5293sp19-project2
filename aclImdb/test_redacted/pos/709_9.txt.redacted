A film that deserved theatrical release. This made-for-television movie is a cinematic gem that exemplifies the technique of XXXXXXX Mann with stirring contemporary music tightly integrated to the visual images. Always with XXX Mann, the amplification of impact by the music is almost as if there is an invisible academy-award-winning actor added to the ensemble of cast, writer, director and cinematographer.<br /><br />This film is definitely one of my all time favorites. While nothing is perfect, this film comes very, very close.<br /><br />Along with an excellent script, great direction and masterful acting by XXXXXXX Strauss, there is an all-star ensemble of character actors at their finest: Roger Mosely; Brian Dennehy; Ed Lauter; Geoffrey Lewis; XXXXXXX Moll; Miguel Pinero; William Prince; Burton Guilliam; Ji-Tu Cumbuka; XXXXXXX Lawson and Billy Green Bush. You may not recognize the names, but you will recognize every face.<br /><br />If this comes on TV, sit down with popcorn, turn up the sound for an amazing soundtrack and score, and prepare to be riveted for the 97 minutes of the film. I highly recommend recording it, since it is only available on VHS and DVD from Holland and the DVD is region 2 encoded.
