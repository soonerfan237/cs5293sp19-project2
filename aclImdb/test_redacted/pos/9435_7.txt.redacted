XXXXXXXX Holmes (Basil Rathbone) and Dr. Watson (Nigel Bruce) have been hired by the British government to protect a Swiss scientist Dr. Franz Tobel (William Post Jr.). He has a bomb that the British want to win the war. Unfortunately the evil Dr. Moriarty (Lionel Atwill) is working with the Nazis and will stop at nothing to get the doctor--and his invention.<br /><br />Moving Sherlock Holmes to the 1940s sounded like a stupid idea but it does work for one reason--XXXXX Rathbone. Arguably he is the BEST Sherlock Holmes ever put on the screen. He plays the character so well (and accurately) that it doesn't matter what era he's solving crimes. As for XXXXX Bruce as Watson...everybody has problems with it. He plays XXXXXX as a bumbling old fool...that is NOT the XXXXXX of the books. You seriously wonder why XXXXXX puts up with him. Still, he does grow on you (in a way). Then there's XXXXXX having a whale of a time playing Moriarty--the discussions and battle of wits between him and Holmes are just great! I've never liked XXXXXX Hoey as Inspector Lestrade--he's such an idiot. XXXXX Watson look like a genius. And XXXX Jr. is pretty good as Tobel (even though his accent amusingly keeps changing!).<br /><br />This movie is done elaborately and runs only a little over an hour. Still, it does have it's slow spots and I never understood the secret code section.<br /><br />Still, worth catching if just for Rathbone and XXXXXX.
