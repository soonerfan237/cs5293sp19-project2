"Back in the Day" is an interesting, but flawed effort. Ja Rule stars as XXXXXX Cooper, a honest but sad man trying to cope with the death of his father. He meets his old friend J-Bone (Ving Rhames) who tries to force XXXXXX into a life of crime. Reggie also falls in love with Alica (XXXXXXX Ali) who is the preacher's daughter. Now he has to choose: Love XX Crime.<br /><br />Ja Rule does a competent job as Reggie. At least he's trying to act. Ving XXXXXX is perfect as J-Bone. He brings a lot of energy and menace into the role. XXX Morton as the preacher is his usual excellent self, but he doesn't do much. The same problem for Giancarlo Esposito as XXXXXX's Dad. He needed more screen time. I don't want to say this, but XXX Grier is pretty awful as Mrs. Cooper. She overacts every scene and brings the movie down. XXX Carrere and Frank Langella are in it but don't do anything substantial for the plot.<br /><br />In the end: You should see it for the skilled performances of Ving Rhames and Joe Morton and the grittiness of the writing and directing.
