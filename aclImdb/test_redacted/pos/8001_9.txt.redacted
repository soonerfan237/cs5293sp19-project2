XXXXXX Returns is a really dark movie, that shows the Caped Crusader fighting against the Penguin and the sexy Catwoman (I'll get to them later). XXXXXXX Keaton acts well as Bruce Wayne, showing he is a good actor. XXX BUrton directs this picture well, and the locations of the movie are impressive. The villains: XXXXX deVito is menacing as the Penguin. A cruel, yet disturbed man, that had a really hard childhood. But, XXXXXXXX Pfeiffer steals the picture. She is the BEST Catwoman ever! She is threatening, and extremely sexy. There's a scene where she kisses Batman the cat way that just heats the movie up. The action scenes are good too, and the ending is dramatic and tragic, probably the best ending of a Batman movie. XXX Burton shows he can manage a Batman movie really well (he already demonstrated this with the first Batman) and also gives Batman a darker nature. So much like him.
