Saw this film during the Mod & Rockers fest in August. I was so inspired and touched. XXXXX had an amazing life and one of the best and distinct voices ever recorded. For those of you who don't know about XXXXX Nilsson do a little research and you'll see that XXXXX has probably found his way into your life in one way or another - maybe it was his 70s special "The Point" or "Everybody's Talking" from Midnight Cowboy. For me it started with "people let me tell you bout my best friend" - the theme song from "The Courtship of Eddie's Father." Watching this film you can really feel the love and admiration from XXXXX's true friends and peers. Don't shed a tear for XXXXX - he had a ball...<br /><br />Brett
