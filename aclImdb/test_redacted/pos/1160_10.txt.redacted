This is one great, sweeping, movie you will remember for a long time. It is about history, America, the change of times, XXXXX XXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXX, a kidnapped American and her children, and the leader of the Berbers, with the blood of the Prophet in his veins.<br /><br />This movie is based on a true story--like XXXXX XXXXX was a banker. An American WAS kidnapped in XXXXXXX and the Marines went part-way to the shores of Tripoli to rescue him. So much for that. You know XXXXXXXXX. Sean Connery is the Berber chieftain and Muslim leader. Candice XXXXXX is the guy who was kidnapped, along with her two kids; the son is XXX XXXXXXXX's grandson, XXXXX, no less. XXXX XXXXXX is Secretary of State, with a great XXXX-XXXXXX-style straight line at a State XXXXXX, watch out for it. Brian Kieth IS XXXXX XXXXXXXXX, all-American, all-male, a character that is an interesting commentary as modern as today.<br /><br />The sweep and beauty of the desert and XXXXXXX are shown beautifully in the cinematography in this film, which will stay with you, a haunting and compelling memory. The score is as sweeping and exotic as the images.<br /><br />This is a story about two cultures, both with grand ideas and historic pasts, struggling for the future without an idea at all about one another. In any event, the struggle comes down to might versus ingenuity.<br /><br />Then at the last, there is the little boy--remember the little boy? What do you think HE thinks?
