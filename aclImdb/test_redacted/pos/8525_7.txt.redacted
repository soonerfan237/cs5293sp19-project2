I've always liked XXXX XXXXXXX, but as XXXXX XXXX I've always favored XXXXX XXXXX. Still it was XXXXXXX who set the Bond standard and while he had by 1983 established himself as something other than XXXXX XXXX, the money must have been irresistible for him to make one more appearance as 007 and save the world from the evil designs of Spectre.<br /><br />And what designs they are in Never Say Never Again. SPECTRE with the help of a foolish young XXX XXXXX officer who happens to be XXX XXXXXXXXX's brother stole two nuclear missiles during a war games exercise and now SPECTRE headed by XXXXXXX, played here by XXX XXX XXXXX is threatening blackmail of the world.<br /><br />Von XXXXX's operations guy is XXXXX XXXXX XXXXXXXXX who is also courting XXXXXXXXX and is a bit on the crazy side. And he's got a female assassin working for him in Barbara XXXXXXX who makes XXXXXXXX XXXXX as XXXX XXXXX look like Mrs. Butterworth.<br /><br />But before XXXX XXXXXXX can even get started he's got to deal with a new 'M' running things at British Intelligence. XXXXXX XXX thinks XXXXXXX is old fashioned in his methods and costs the British taxpayers too much money with his violent ways. I really did enjoy XXX's performance, he's like the great grandson of Colonel Blimp.<br /><br />I also enjoyed XXXXXXX, she's something to look at and quite resourceful in her methods. When she's scuba diving with XXXXXXX in the Bahamas, note how she puts XXX XXXXX on 007's case.<br /><br />XXXX XXXXXXX do XXXXX XXXX again? He was widely quoted as saying who would they cast him as at this point, XXXXX XXXXX's father? But I think XXXXXXX would still be formidable in a wheelchair.
