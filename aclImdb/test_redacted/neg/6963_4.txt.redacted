First of all, XX Wood Jr. is not the worst director ever, Plan 9 From Outer Space not withstanding. XXXXXXX Francis deserves that title. I present XXXXXXX B, Glen or Glenda.<br /><br />The first half of the movie consists of a surprisingly thoughtful exploration of crossdressing, especially since it was made in 1953. The last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.<br /><br />This is not to say the movie doesn't have problems. XXXX Lugosi was totally extraneous, intoning odd lines. XXXX Bela looked like even he wasn't sure what was happening at times. The acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period XXXXXXXXX B movie. The long dream sequence that makes up the middle of the film was totally bizarre; more like a vaguely menacing stag film than a dream sequence. The Alan/Ann story, the supposed original focus of the film has a tacked on quality about it.<br /><br />No, XX Wood Jr. is not the worst director ever. He was able, at least for part of this movie, to make an earnest social statement. When XXXXXXX Francis tried to do that in Night Train To Mundo Fine (aka Red Zone Cuba), it just ended in chaos. XXXX or XXXXda is at least watchable without Robot help.
