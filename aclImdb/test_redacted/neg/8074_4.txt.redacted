The movie was a pleasure to watch if you are a fan of the Stooges. The story is told from the point of view of XXX Howard and his relationships with his brothers Shemp and Jerome (Curly) Howard, also the life long friendship with Larry Fine. The movie deals mostly with the off camera high points and pit falls of the Stooges multi decade career. The casting director and makeup artist did a fair job of finding actors who resembled the famous ensemble. The actor who plays "Curly" XXXXXX did a fine job of portraying the on camera antics of the most beloved Stooge. A must see for any fan of XXXXX Stooges shorts.
