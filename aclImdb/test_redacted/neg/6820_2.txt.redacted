Dooley and his canine partner, XXXXX Lee are together again in this 2nd sequel (?!!?) I sincerely had no clue that they made one sequel let alone two. And for a film that was only slight better than "XXXXXX & Hooch"? This time after Dooley retires, he has to mate his dog (with other dogs, people) and wait around for XXXXX Lee to poo. Real classy stuff. I mean come on now. The original had at least a few good laugh. This one has nary a one. XXX Belushi just looks old and worn out. Both Belushi brothers were great in the '80's. If XXXX hadn't died, would he be so bad today like his brother? That thought makes me sad for some reason.<br /><br />My Grade: D- <br /><br />Where i saw it: USA network
