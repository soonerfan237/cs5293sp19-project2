If you like XXXX XXXXXX, this is one of his best roles. His gentle intensity to right a wrong is what made his career. "XXXXXX XXXXXXXXX" comes to Dallas to take revenge against XXXX and XXXXX XXXXXX, who burned his Georgia farm and killed his family. XXXXX Marshall gets in XXXXXXXXX's way, attempting to arrest him when interrupted by a street shootout between XXXXXXXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXXXXX. The shootout is staged to get the law off XXXXXXXXX, & he takes the "back East" Marshall under his wing to keep him alive in Texas, as they switch identity. <br /><br />That was a great beginning, and the picture holds up all the way through. Action may be a little "slow" by today's standards, but it is one of my top 10 favorite movies.
