Travis and Sandy(XXX XXXXXXX and XXXXX XXXXX, Jr.)are horse traders coerced into selling their animals to a Mormon group and guiding them across the frontier to a settlement. What they do not expect is to encounter the notorious Clegg murderers, with their wounded leader XXXXX XXXXXX(XXXXXXX XXXXXX). XXXX XXXX portrays XXXXX XXXXX, the main voice for the Mormon group moving the wagon train to the Lord's destination. Along the way, they also encounter "Doctor" A Locksley Hall and his "XXXXXXX XXXXXXX XXXXX" and lend them help.<br /><br />Lovingly directed by Ford who pays close attention to detail with realistic problems any group would encounter during a rugged wagon trail. The film has a wonderful cast made up of character actors with nary a true star in the film which is actually a blessing to see, if just not for a change of pace. XXXXX XXXXXXX and XXXXX, Jr. come off real well, but this is XXXX's film to shine as he has the best lines. XXXXXXX is the one who seems to understand ruffians and brutes like XXXXXX and will certainly come in handy when certain conflict might develop as the Clegg boys ride along side them a piece.<br /><br />I'd have to say this is one of his best and most least appreciated westerns and seems to flow very well.
