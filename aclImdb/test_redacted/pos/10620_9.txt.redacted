I have seen this movie, just once, and I'm looking forward to see it again and again. XXXX David (from Beligium), why did you bother to write a comment on this movie? I only think we can think about you (after reading you comment), is that you're provably a non-sexual person (like XXXXX in the movie), and you are not ready for the new cinema that is coming up. I guess you are a bit old, and sexual expression is not part of your "visage". The Cannes Film Festival is by far the best movie festival, and I'm is my pleasure to say, that this film was awarded with: XXXX Actress, XXXX Actor and Grand Prix. XXXXXXXX Huppert is magnificent, as always, who would do this movie like her? One of her best performances ever. The music is fantastic, and once more XXXXXXX Haneke puts reality in the big screen. It's like a Dogma95 kind of movie, because of the topic. Try to see it.<br /><br />
