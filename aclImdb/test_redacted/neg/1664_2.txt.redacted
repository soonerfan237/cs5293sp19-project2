XXXXX Arvidson (as Jennie) and Harry Solter (as Frank) are enjoying a romantic tryst, when in walks her father Charles Inslee; furious, he chases Mr. Solter out of the house. Undaunted, he goes to her balcony and begs her to elope. Ms. XXXXXXXX is agreeable, and goes to pack. Then, burglar XXXXXX Gebhardt arrives to rob the place. Though he doesn't get much in the way of booty, thieving Gebhardt manages to use XXXXXXXX's trunk to escape from the policeÂ… <br /><br />A Contrived Comedy. Note, during the balcony scene, XXXXXX goes off-camera, so burglar Gebhardt can enter the house undetected. And, XXXXXXXX travels very light, since there appears to be nothing in her heavy trunk; perhaps she just wanted to buff up beau Solter? XXXXXXXX D.W. Griffith, Robert Harron, and Florence Lawrence are illustrious extras. <br /><br />** A Calamitous Elopement (8/7/08) D.W. Griffith ~ XXXXXX Gebhardt, Linda Arvidson, Harry Solter
