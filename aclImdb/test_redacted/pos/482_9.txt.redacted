There are times I am convinced that The XXXXXX is the best XXXXXXXX & XXXXXXX opera ever, but that is only so long as I'm not listening to Iolanthe. Be that as it may, The XXXXXX is probably the most frequently filmed of the Savoy Operas. (Yes, I put the composer first. Nobody says XXXXXXXXXXX and Rodgers, or XXXX and Rodgers, or XXXXX and XXXXX, or What's-His-Face and XXXXXXX. You don't even hear the names of librettists for Offenbach, XXXXX, or Balfe. XXXXXXX was just the bigger name (and the bigger ego) at the time, so they put his name first. It's time that silly practice was put to rest.<br /><br />Anyway, The XXXXXX is a compleat S&G operetta. It has some of XXXXXXXX's catchiest numbers, combined with some of XXXXXXX's cleverest lyrics. It has an interesting book and sprightly dialogue. It's got a wonderful degree of craziness. And it leaves the door wide open for elaborate and whimsical costuming.<br /><br />This particular production, filmed in a live performance in 1990, turns its imagination toward striking simplicity. Set in a British seaside resort toward the end of the Art Nouveau period, it throws over the japonerie of the original entirely. The result is costuming and setting in an eye-caressing medley of whites, grey, and blacks, accented by occasional bits of red (and less frequent uses of yellow and green). It takes some getting used to, but it's really spiffy. Of course, when the chorus tells you they are gentlemen of Japan, you would be right to exclaim, "Oh, pooh. Bah!" (Did I just say that?) It's most gratifying that this fine production is now on DVD. However, one caveat: the print seems to be photographed through a glass of imperfect clarity, so that the expected sharpness of the image is softened and ever so slightly fuzzy. The tendency to superimpose images is, alas, annoying. Why do people who are doing a really spiffy production want to muck it up with artsy-fartsy stuff of that sort? But it's the performance that counts the most. We may skip the overture, since although one is performed, XXXXXXXX never wrote one. (True, it may be so he wrote none for any of the Savoys. But the XXXXXX overture doesn't even date from XXXXXXXX's lifetime and was compiled by observing the techniques used in the others.) As for the rest of the operetta, it's first-rate and supremely funny.<br /><br />The Ko-Ko here is the estimable XXXX XXXX, who does it credit. There is a tradition of bringing a Big Name into the role. The was a U.S. TV production years ago in which Ko-Ko was played by XXXXXXX XXXX with mixed results. Idle's performance is delightfully quirky ... he does "Taken from a county jail" assisted by a tennis racquet. His "I've Got a Little List" is done as a speech to a microphone -- of course it has the usual updated lyrics, which are much funnier than the usual run of such things, and his delivery is positively hysterical. It goes on that way throughout.<br /><br />In this operetta, it's important to have a good Katisha; it's just no fun if you're not being bellowed at in style. This XXXXXX has a fabulous Katisha in Felicity Palmer, in her way almost as Big a Name as Idle. She bellows with the best of them in a wonderful rich contralto ... wonderful, especially, for a soprano. And her costume...!!! (Not to mention her recital with XXXXX XXXXX, apparently, accompanying.) Nanki-XXX is played by XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXX. I have trouble getting around is somewhat un-Nanki-XXXish chubby shortness -- but is voice is undeniably a solid, rich addition to the vocal palette. There is a nice touch during "A Wand'ring Minstrel", where the chorus reacts with distaste to the mention of "his nancy on his knee" -- bear in mind the XXXXXX's decree about flirting. Be that as it may, XXXXXXX is a fine singing actor and if his appearance doesn't put the best face on Nanki-XXX, his performance does.<br /><br />Yum-Yum (XXXXXX XXXXXX) and her friends are appropriately pretty and silly. She and XXXXXXX do lovely duets. Pish-Tush (XXXX XXXXXXXXXX) plays his persona as something a blageur and does it very well. XXX Bah (XXXXXXX XXX XXXXX) is wonderful as a stuffed shirt out of water ... a role later done to death in American sitcoms (you know: haughty butlers forced to cater to bratty children -- that sort of thing). The XXXXXX (XXXXXXX XXXXX) is bloody marvelous, with an imperious voice at absolute variance with his ridiculous lyrics.<br /><br />I don't recommend you get this as your only XXXXXX. Get a good traditional production as well, so you can see what XXXXXXX intended (more or less) in terms of staging. That being said, I'll watch this one twice while viewing any traditional bit once. On the whole this is a terrific offering, a vocal and visual delight, with delicious over-acting. It's a DVD to treasure, with dervish-like maids, tap-dancing bellhops, and all. Watch for the bellhops with signs.
