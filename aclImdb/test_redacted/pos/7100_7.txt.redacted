This film marked the end of the "serious" XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX era (XXXXXX and XXXXXXXX meet up with the monsters later in "XXXXXX and XXXXXXXX Meet Frankentstein"). It was a somewhat desparate, yet fun attempt to revive the classic monsters of the Wolf Man, XXXXXXXXXXXX's monster, and XXXXXXX one "last" time.<br /><br />I say desparate, because in the previous film, "House of XXXXXXXXXXXX," both XXXXXXX and the Wolf Man are killed according to how the vampire and werewolf legends say they should be (XXXXXXX by the sunlight, and the wolf man by a silver bullet). Yet somehow they return in House of XXXXXXX with no explanation. This movie could have played as a kind of prequel to House of XXXXXXXXXXXX if the XXXXXXXXXXXX monster plot wouldn't be continuing chronologically into House of XXXXXXX from House of XXXXXXXXXXXX, and if the wolf man didn't get cured. Then there'd be no plot holes. But since this is not the case, the plots of XXXXXXX and the Wolf Man make no sense.<br /><br />However, ignoring these plot holes, House of XXXXXXX is a classic atmospheric horror film that's fun to watch. It has many high points. Especially seeing the wolf man get cured. I know I just said that this shouldn't have been included, but it was nice to actually see him get cured after all this time. And the scene with the lady playing "XXXXXXXXX XXXXXX," on the piano then all of a sudden playing a haunting melody when under XXXXXXX's spell was very eerie. Dr. XXXXXXX's transformation into the "Dr. Jekyl/Mr. Hyde" type character was also done very well.<br /><br />And it's great to see XXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXX, and the Wolf Man together, one "last" time.<br /><br />*** out of ****
