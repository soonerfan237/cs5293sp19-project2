Watching this PPV, I had high expectations for it, since XXXXXXXXX is the best show in WWE, this is a very good PPV as it is the last one before Wrestlemania.<br /><br />FIRST MATCH-HARDY BOYS & CHRIS BENOIT VS. MVP & MNM W/ MELINA IN A 6 MAN TAG TEAM MATCH Good way to start the match. It started a bit slow at the start, but later the pace quickened & the match got more exciting & entertaining. Benoit rolls through & makes XXXX XXXXXXX tap out to get a victory for the Hardy Boys & himself. 6/10<br /><br />SECOND MATCH- GREGORY HELMS {CHAMPION} VS. SHANNON MOORE VS. FUNAKI VS. CHAVO GUERRERO VS. DAIVAIRI VS. SCOTTY 2 HOTTY VS. JAMIE NOBLE VS. JIMMY WANG YANG IN AN OPEN CRUISERWEIGHT INVITATIONAL MATCH FOR THE WWE CRUISERWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP I'm a very big fan of Cruiserweights, & I never get disappointed watching them, especially in this match here. XXXXX Guerrero nails the Frog Splash on XXXXX XXXX XXXX to get the win & become the new WWE Cruiserweight Champion. 5/10<br /><br />THIRD MATCH- FINLAY & LITTLE BASTARD VS. BOOGEYMAN & LITTLE BOOGEYMAN This was not really a wrestling match, it was more like a comedy match, despite not being a clear wrestling contest, it still entertained me with the funny antics. Finlay nails the Little XXXXXXXXX with the Shillaegh to get the win. XXXXXXXXX does not deserve to be on a PPV, & does not deserve to be in WWE. 4/10<br /><br />FOURTH MATCH- KANE VS. KING BOOKER W/ SHARMELL This was a surprisingly good match, I thought it would be mediocre, but it turned out into a real competitive wrestling contest. Hats off to both men, pulling a very entertaining match. Kane wins after a Chokeslam on King Booker. 6/10<br /><br />FIFTH MATCH- PAUL London & BRIAN KENDRICK {CHAMPIONS} VS. DEUCE & DOMINO W/ CHERRY FOR THE WWE TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIPS Not really that much of a good match, XXXXX & Domino need more training to wrestle, & London & XXXXXXXX are the only ones keeping this match fast paced. London & XXXXXXXX retain their titles, after XXXXXXXX gets a roll-up on one of the guys for the win. 4/10<br /><br />SIXTH MATCH- BOBBY LASHLEY {CHAMPION} VS. MR. KENNEDY FOR THE ECW CHAMPIONSHIP XXX XXXXXXX attacks XXXXXXX from behind, before the match starts. It was an okay match, but not really good. XXXXXXX & XXXXXXX have a bit of chemistry, but not enough to pull a great match. XXXXXXX wins by DQ, after XXXXXXX nails him with a chair, then assaults him with the chair all the way to the entrance area. XXXXXXX still retains his title. 4/10<br /><br />SEVENTH MATCH- XXXX XXXX & SHAWN MICHAELS VS. BATISTA & UNDERTAKER This is probably the greatest tag team match that I have ever seen. Hats off to all of these men {yes even XXXXXXX} for pulling off as close as a 5 star main event classic. All 4 of these men played their parts in the match very well, as this was a very great & entertaining tag team match. XXXXXXX turns his back on Undertaker spine-busting him, then leaving the ring, which prompts XXXXXXXX to nail XXXXX XXXX XXXXX, then XXXX to nail an F-U for the hard fought victory. 7/10<br /><br />I don't know why everyone says that this PPV is not good enough, or it is boring, I just don't get it. It is a great PPV which XXXXXXXXX always delivers. A great PPV indeed.<br /><br />Overall I'll give it 8/10 & a B+
