Said to be inspired from Disney's The Little Mermaid, XXXXX on the XXXXX by the Sea is Japanese animation master, XXXXX XXXXXXXX's next big work after the well-received Spirited Away in 2001 and XXXX's Moving Castle in 2004. In XXXXX, his signature style of animating fantasy realms and children characters are on display once again.<br /><br />XXXXXX (Hiroki Doi), the boy lead in the film discovers a 'goldfish' trapped in a glass jar while playing by the seaside below the cliff. He stays with his mum, Lisa (XXXXXX XXXXXXXXX) above and atop it. XXXXXX shakes the jar forcefully to try and get the 'goldfish' out but the little 'goldfish' is stuck. He then tries to pull it out but it just cannot come loose. XXXXXX then place the jar on the ground before smashing a small rock onto it, breaking it into pieces instantly while suffering a small cut on the finger. He then checks inquisitively to see if the 'goldfish' is still alive. As he observes it, the 'goldfish' reacts by licking the blood off his finger suddenly. Excited, XXXXXX quickly rushes back to the house and put the 'goldfish' in a small bucket of water in hope that it will survive. It did and he named it 'XXXXX'(XXXXX XXXX).<br /><br />The above scene would signify what is to come for the remainder of the film. It is of the interactions between XXXXXX and XXXXX. And it is one that XXXXX XXXXXXXX did meticulously well in portraying. He must have a keen sense of observation and understanding of how children behave before he depicts this chemistry of communication between the two main characters. The behavior of the children would also extend into the rest of the film in their further encounters.<br /><br />The affection between XXXXXX and XXXXX grew as the film progresses from the moment XXXXXX brought XXXXX to school in Lisa's car. The best moment came when the two were reunited after a brief separation when XXXXX's father, Fujimoto (XXXXXX XXXXXX), a magical sea dweller recaptures the errant XXXXX before encapsulating her in a magic bubble with kind intention.<br /><br />Fujimoto who was once human has grown to refer humans with disgust for polluting the sea and stealing its life. But all XXXXX wants is to be human and be with XXXXXX so for a second time she escapes, accidentally emptying his father's precious store of magical elixir into the sea, creating a storm of tidal waves and engulfing the small town in the process.<br /><br />What follows are the adventures of XXXXXX and XXXXX in the flooded town.<br /><br />Is there a happily ever after in this one? Would true love prevail? You find out.<br /><br />Looking at the art in XXXXX on the XXXXX by the Sea, there appears to be a deviation from XXXXXXXX's past works in terms of rendering. It looks unfamiliar because the environment apart from the characters at play in every scene is not colored in the usual fashion as in Spirited Away (2001) and XXXX's Moving Castle (2004). The aesthetical appeal is discounted from what appears to be color penciled drawings. The objects and characters are also not as detailed as before.<br /><br />This is peculiar if taken on face value but from the way the story is written and told, the possible explanation is that XXXXXXXX is allowing the audience to view the film with a child's tint, yet allowing the adults to reminisce on a Japan when they were younger. This move could have prevented prospective moviegoers, new to XXXXXXXX's work to see it. The trailer did nothing to promote XXXXX as well. Taking the case to Japan however would be a different story as XXXXXXXX's credential far than exceed any marketing technique.<br /><br />In summary though, the whole did not equal to its parts. Aside from XXXXXXXX's ability to cast vivacious and animated characters, the film lacks elements of thrill and wonder when measured against previous works, resulting in a deficit of big screen presence.<br /><br />The sparks of XXXXX and XXXXXX failed to light up the film in a big way but moments of warmth, kindness, and love can still be found in recognizing the film as one that is not made for the kids, but of the kids who everyone is or once was.
