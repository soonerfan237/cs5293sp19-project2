XXXXXXXXX Muthamittal is for sure a great movie. I have to give it to XXXX Ratnam for a great directing job and A.R. XXXXXX for great songs. The camera work is just excellent and is similar to XXXXX Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan. I will be shocked if this movie does not win an Oscar for XXXX Foreign Film or even XXXX Camera Work.
