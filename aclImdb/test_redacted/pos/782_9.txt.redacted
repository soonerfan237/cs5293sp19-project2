I only heard about XXXXXXX XXXXXXX through the ITV adverts, and to be honest, I didn't know how much I would like it. I switched on the TV last night and was totally surprised. XXXXXXX XXXXXXX is a modest, simple film which draws you in right from the start. XXXXXX Grint plays the part of socially awkward teenager XXX brilliantly. He's definitely one to look out for in the future. XXXX Eve XXXXXX is played by the fabulous XXXXX XXXXXXX. I loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity. The highlight of the film, for me was XXXX's rather colourful poem. It shows how friendships can form between the most unlikely pairs. In my opinion, watching XXXXXXX XXXXXXX is a great way to spend 2 hours. The scenery was also striking, especially the countryside. Anyone who can call this sparkling comedy forgettable, I strongly disagree with
