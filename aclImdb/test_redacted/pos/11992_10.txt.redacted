Like XXXXXXX XXXXX, XXXXX never got the material he deserved. Whatever you know of him is probably wrong. Get past the accent and go see his stand-up. You'll be very surprised -- he's one of the best stand-ups I've ever seen and I have seen a lot of stand-up comedy (from XXXXX XXXXX to XXXXX XXXXXX to XXXXX XXXXXXXX to XXXXX XXXX -- Jackie XXXXX is definitely up there). He's known for being a comic's comic. Even XXXXXX XXXXX said he is one of the top 3 funniest comedians ever.<br /><br />The accussation that XXXXX is no XXXXXXXXXXX is ridiculous. XXXXXXXXXXX is known for having been a huge XXXXX fan. XXXXXXXXXXX's career was going nowhere for a long time until he started following XXXXX's shows. That is when XXXXX provided XXXXXXXXXXX with inspiration for his, "get no respect" routine. While I think XXXXXXXXXXX is great, see them both do stand-up and you'll see XXXXX is the better comedian.
