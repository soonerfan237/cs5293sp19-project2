This is one of the best action films I have seen. XXXXX's portrayal of the tough as nails, 'Charly'/gentle mother 'Sam', was superb and XXXXXX X XXXXXXX just keeps you laughing all the way through, with his classic one liners. Sure, there were a few holes in the actual story, but this fast-paced flick keeps you on the edge of your seat to the end.<br /><br />I felt XXXXX was a perfect choice for the role of Sam/Charly and her versatility as an actress is evident for her role as the mother in the recent movie 'Stuart XXXXXX'. Both XXXXXX and XXXXX were well supported by XXXXX XXXXX, XXXXX XXX, sweet little XXXXXX XXXX and newcomers, sexy XXXXX XXXXXX, and XXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX. This film accentuates the growing trend of strong female character and the diversion away from traditional male/female stereotypes as we see Sam/Charly (XXXXX) and Mitch (XXXXXXX) hurtling from one disaster to the next.<br /><br />While I and many others loved this movie, it is fair to say that there will always be people that don't and that's fine - each, to their own. I highly recommend this film to action fans, for its hilarious scenes and fast-paced action.
