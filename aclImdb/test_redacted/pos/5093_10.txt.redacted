XXXXX O'Toole gives a brilliant performance in this movie. I have seen the original version with XXXXXX Donat and I much prefer Peter O'Toole's performance and the movie in general even though it is a musical. I've really never seen anything that XXX O'Toole is in that I don't like. He is a brilliant actor, multi-talented, giving performances full of passion and depth. XXXXXX Clark also gave a surprisingly good performance and was perfect for the part. It is an all-around heartwarming movie, full of tenderness and bittersweet fun. I will always remember (in para-phrase) the line where XXX Chips regrets he has never given her children, and she replies, "Of course you have, hundreds of them -- all boys." Thank you for the opportunity to vote for this movie and to voice my opinion.
