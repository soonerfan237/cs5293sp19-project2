30 years after the original film, "XXXXXXX, XXX XXXXX" was made over as a musical. XXXXX O'Toole and XXXXXX XXXXXX starred in this wonderful remake of the beloved schoolteacher, Chippington, who is referred to as Chips by his beloved wife.<br /><br />O'Toole was excellent here and received another Oscar nomination. You have to wonder what XXXXX O'Toole has to do to win an Oscar. He has lost the coveted award 8 times now. You also have to wonder that he lost in 1969 to XXXX XXXXX for "XXXX XXXX," which was really a testament to XXX XXXXX's long career and popularity. This year was also marked by great performances by XXXXXXX XXXXXX, "Anne of the Thousand Days," as well as XXXXXX XXXXXXX and XXX XXXXXX for "XXXXXXXX XXXXXX."<br /><br />Surprised to see XXXXXX XXXXXX cast as Mrs. Chippington. However, as this was a musical, a beautiful voice came well through and she did a nice piece of acting as well.<br /><br />Who can forget the scene when Chips carries on in the class despite the news that his beloved has been killed in a bombing. He never got to tell her the wonderful news of his pending promotion.<br /><br />The beautiful cinematography and music only enhanced a truly memorable experience.
