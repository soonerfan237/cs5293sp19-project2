If you liked XXXXX XXXXXXXXX's "XXXXXXX" you'll probably like this black comedy as well, as it's another brilliant XXXXXXXXX script, a wonderful satire on big-city hospitals and a perfect vehicle for XXX. C. XXXXX. He plays a burned-out chief of medicine on the most chaotic day he or his hospital have ever seen. His personal crisis is coming to a head and his hospital's falling down around him, as local residents demonstrate against the hospital and patients and doctors are dying at an alarming rate, thanks to a biblically-inspired and murderous saboteur. The latter, who theatrically declares himself the "Fool for XXXXXX," "Parakleet of Kaborka," "Wrath of the Lamb," and "Angel of the Bottomless Pit," bops doctors on the head, administers lethal injections and swaps patients' identities, causing treatments and operations to be performed on the wrong persons.<br /><br />This film makes you uncomfortable, as deadly mistakes like these do happen (hopefully not so many, not so often and not in one place) and at the same time makes you laugh at the priceless character portraits. One is XXXXXXX XXXXXX ("L.A. Law") as Dr. Wellbeck, a sort of celebrity surgeon who spends far more time worrying about his investments and publicly-traded stock than about his patients, who suffer lethally from his vast indifference and neglect. There's XXXXX XXXX as free-spirited, hippie-ish XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX, who seduces the beleaguered chief of medicine (XXXXX) and tries to get him to run away with her. Then there's the deluded murderer, who happens to be XXXXXXX's father and who "functions well enough" back at the Indian reservation where he lives with his daughter and even runs a clinic, but who's pushed to madness merely by being placed back in civilization. The strongest portrait by far is XXXXX's Dr. XXXX, who bares his soul as former boy genius, failed father and husband, brilliant doctor and responsible administrator, who constantly dreams of suicide but must bear up under the demands of his job. XXXXX is exceptional in this demanding role.<br /><br />Until the final scenes one doesn't know if XXXX will leave the hospital behind for XXXXXXX's Indian reservation and a quieter, simpler life, whether her murderous father will be caught or whether the protesting, rioting locals will take over and bring the hospital to its knees. Watching the crazed killer at work, one suspects XXXXXXXXX is telling us our lunatic society makes him do these things, as we're told he's a different person away from cities and people.<br /><br />As my own father was the chief administrator of a number of large hospitals over the years, I had some idea of the demands of his job and the huge responsibility he shouldered. This story makes that responsibility the linchpin on which XXXXX's crisis turns. This is both a funny and scary film, with the actors up to the considerable demands of XXXXXXXXX's script. It's also a film I get more out of each time I watch it.
