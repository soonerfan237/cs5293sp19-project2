Very disturbing, but expertly crafted & scripted and intelligently directed with a good eye for color and detail. XXXX Beth Hurt, Sandy Dennis, and especially Randy Quaid are unusually good. The story centers around a young boy (XXXXX Madorsky) wondering where all the leftovers they eat every night comes from. His parents (Hurt, Quaid) strange behavior causes the school psychiatrist (XXXXXX) to get involved. It is a gruesome cannibal movie. But it's not bad. If you like XXXXXXXX, you'll love this. If you don't like Parents, stay away from the film. Just giving advice to XXXXXXXX Lover and Haters.<br /><br />Rated R for Strong Adult Themes and Graphic Violence.
