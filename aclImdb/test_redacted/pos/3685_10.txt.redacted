We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat-- Not your usual XXXXXXXXX drivel.<br /><br />My husband had a Blockbuster coupon and passed on a string of new releases of violent XXXXXXXXX stuff. He was about to walk out when he saw this and decided to take a chance. There was only one copy -- and with some glitches in the DVD that we finally had to flip to wide screen version and then back to the full screen version to make it stop stalling. But it was worth it. XXXXX Bates is so good and she was so perfect for the role. And she can sing too! <br /><br />If only XXXXXXXXX would learn from Independent film makers! Maybe we would go back to the real movies. But for now, we're sticking with off beat and really entertaining films like this one! Other examples we've enjoyed include: A Box Full of Moonlight, XXXXXX of April, Delivering Milo, The Celestine Prophesy. Most of the ones by XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXX such as: Best in Show, For your Consideration, A Mighty Wind, and Waiting for XXXXXXX
