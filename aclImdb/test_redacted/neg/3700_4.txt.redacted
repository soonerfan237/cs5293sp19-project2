"Haaaarrrryyy!" <br /><br />The amplified, dispassionate female voice could have been XXXXX Helmseley in heat but, no, it belongs to Allison Hayes as Nancy Archer, the 50-Foot Woman of the title. In the most infamous role of her film career, XXXXXXX's performance literally rips off the roof. In fact, make that a couple of roofs.<br /><br />Jaw-droppingly tacky, "Aot50FW" is the tale of Nancy, a neurotic, boozy heiress and her loveless XXXXXXXX husband, Harry (William Hudson, who also co-starred opposite The Amazing Colossal Man). XXXXX has a close encounter of the third kind, in the desert, with a bald giant from outer space who wears a mini-skirt and gladiator sandals, and who has a thing for XXXXX's jewelry. What he does to her once he's carried her off is probably best left a mystery, but soon XXXXX starts to grow.<br /><br />Treading into the center of town on tranquilizers, tightly wrapped in nothing but the bed sheets, the buxom giantess heads toward the low-rent saloon where Harry is having a few laughs with a floozy named Honey (Yvette Vickers). The confrontation turns ugly.<br /><br />The Poverty Row f/x make the alien giant and XXXXX appear to be transparent due to incompetently transposed images. You'll understand why director XXXXXX Juran changed his name to XXXXXX Hertz on the credits. XXXXX was no stranger to directing giant creatures, human and non, having also directed "The Deadly Mantis," "The 7th Voyage of Sinbad," "Jack, the Giant Killer" plus several episodes of TV's "World of Giants" and "Land of the Giants." <br /><br />A lot of laughs for all the wrong reasons.
