Perhaps I was just in a really good mood when I watched this film. but, for whatever reason, I really liked this film. Was it terribly original? No. Was it a bit predictable? Yes. And so what? It was still a really nice movie. I've always liked XXXXX XXXXXX (well, almost always, there was XXXXXX XXXX and The Fifth Element, after all), and he portrayed a selfish, sarcastic b***ard perfectly. Maybe this movie isn't XXXXXXX XXXXX material, but it sure is feel good material. Go rent it.
