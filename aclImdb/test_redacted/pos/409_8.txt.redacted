Red Skelton (in his first starring role) plays XXXXX Benton who plays 'The Fox' on a radio show. He writes the murder mysteries and as 'The XXX' solves them. XXXXXX Jones (Conrad Veidt) is trying to figure out how to perform the perfect murder on someone. He kidnaps XXXXXX, his girlfriend (Ann Rutherford) and another girlfriend (Virginia Grey). He tells XXXXXX to write out the perfect murder...or his girlfriends get it...<br /><br />Very funny and enjoyable movie. Fast-moving (it's only 77 minutes), a good script and perfect casting really puts this across. Skelton is very good in his first starring role--very funny, fast, handsome and intelligent. Veidt is excellent as the evil XXXXX. Rutherford and Grey are lots of fun as XXXXXXX's girlfriends. All three of them play off each other perfectly--their verbal sparring is the highlight of this pic. Also fun to see XXX Arden in a small role.<br /><br />Well worth your time.
