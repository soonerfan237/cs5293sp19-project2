Cleopatra 2525 is a very funny, entertaining show. You shouldn't take all the show seriously, but if you wanna have fun, that's your TV show. Being made by the producers of XXXX is a quality guarantee, and Cleopatra 2525 isn't that different from XXXX. The female warriors formula is brought to the future, where they don't have to fight warriors or gods, but dangerous robots which dwell in the surface, and the humans are forced to live underground. Along the two seasons of Cleopatra, they develop an interesting and funny underground world, and we get to know the three main characters: Cleopatra (Jennifer Sky), Hel (XXXX XXXXXX) and Sarge (Victoria Pratt). They all are different, but as a team, they work really well. The three main actresses appeared previously in XXXX, like most of the regular/guest cast (there are some known faces from XXXXXXXX too, or from both shows). I specially liked the character played by XXXXXXXX XXXXXXX (Ephiny in XXXX), which is very different from any of her roles I previously knew. So if you liked XXXX and XXXXXXXX, you'll love Cleopatra 2525. If you don't know them, try it: I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
