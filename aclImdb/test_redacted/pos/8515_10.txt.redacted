Background info - The movies XXXXXXXXX & XXXXX XXX XXXXX XXXXX were both made the same year, 1983, and so naturally people compare them. Moore vs. XXXXXXX. XXXX vs. XXXX.<br /><br />I've heard many people claiming that the "official movie" XXXXXXXXX is far superior. Well, I just watched XXXXXXXXX. XXXX is riding an airplane at 100 miles an hour (impossible---the wind would blow him off), using his feet to force the plane to ground, and then jumping off at some 60 miles an hour (again impossible---try jumping out of your car---you'd end up with a shattered body). How is that octopussy scene supposed to be "good" in any sense of the word? Suddenly XXXX has super-human strength & a titanium body. And he does all these stunts at the ancient age of 56??? Complete crap. Unbelievable. Farse.<br /><br />---> Now let's contrast the above scene with XXXXXXX's "unofficial" XXXXX XXX XXXXX XXXXX: It doesn't have the same polish due to its independent film status (less money), but at least you can believe that XXXXXXX is a real spy in real danger.<br /><br />The movie starts off with XXXX showing his age (he is 50 after all) and being sent off for recuperation. Entirely believable. But of course, there's no such thing as a "day off" for a world-famous spy, and XXXX quickly finds himself a target, even inside the hospital. From that point the story spins off into another adventure, with XXXX trying to locate his attempted killers and ultimately foiling an attempt to steal nuclear weapons.<br /><br />As usual Sean XXXXXXX did a brilliant job, and avoids the over-the-top/unbelievable stunts. This movie feels like a natural successor to XXXXXXX's last film, 1971's Diamonds Are Forever... the old style of XXXX... before the franchise got silly.<br /><br />XXXXXXX recommended.
