The first time I've seen this DVD, I was not only happy because of the fact that it was the first time in decades that the band put out anything, but also because the DVD itself is extremely loud. XXXXX Page obviously can't live with quiet music, I guess. I do must say though that during the concert at Royal XXXXXX Hall, they expanded 'How many more times' and 'Moby Dick' too long. Other than that, it was exquisit. My favorite song of all time is now on that DVD. Trampled XXXXXXXXX. It's either that one or 'In my time of dying'. In that song, XXXXX really plays that thing good. Ever seen XXXXX Rhoads play? Well, XXXXX plays just like him, except his guitar is lower.
