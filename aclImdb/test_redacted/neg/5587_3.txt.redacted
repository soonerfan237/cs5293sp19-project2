I'm sorry, ELO fans, but I was disappointed with this concert at the CBS Television City in Los Angeles. It's decent music-wise, but the presentation is simply boring - big-time. Most of the songs sound the same and lead singer-writer XXXX Lynne is about as animated as a store mannequin. He has a pleasant voice, but he isn't much to watch. He just stands in one spot and sings for an hour and 40 minutes. The songs all sound like 1970s-1980s bubblegum stuff: pleasant but not exciting.<br /><br />Lynn is accompanied by a very pretty woman, XXXXX Vela, but she isn't too animated, either. The only song - out of 23 - that creates any excitement is the last one: "XXXX Over Beethoven." Now if only some of the other 22 songs had that excitement to them, this could have been a much better concert DVD.
