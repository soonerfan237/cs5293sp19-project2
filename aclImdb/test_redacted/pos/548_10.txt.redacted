Anne (XXXXXXX Portman) tells us about how much she hates her mother, XXXXX (XXXXXX XXXXXXXX). That's how the movie begins. XXXXX decided that her and her daughter were moving to California without asking anyone and leaving her husband without any reason. The story is about the relationship between the mother and the daughter. It's really deep and touching, thanks to the great work of the actresses. XXXXXXX was nominated to a Golden Globe for that role. She is one of the most talented actresses I ever saw, and so is XXXXXXXX. They really look like mother daughter. The soundtrack is also great. The movie is incredible. *10 out of 10*
