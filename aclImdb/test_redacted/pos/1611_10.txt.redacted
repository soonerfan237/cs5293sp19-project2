Are sea side resorts the sad, dreary places they're always depicted as in movies and novels? Certainly this movie, along with the near-contemporary "Don't Look Now" depicts Venice as a particularly squalid and decadent tourist trap (for a more light-hearted approach, see "Just Married" with XXXXXX XXXXXXX and Brittany Murphy). Having never been to Venice I can't say for sure, but it does make a perfect setting for this somber but sumptuous spectacle from XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX, one of the great stylists of world cinema. Having seen the movie I now wish I had gotten around to reading the Thomas Mann novella it's based on (which also inspired an opera by XXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXX). Since I don't know the back story and the movie has little in the way of plot or exposition, I'm left wondering about XXXXXXXXXX (XXXX Bogarde)'s obsession with young XXXXXX. Is he a homosexual? A pedophile? Or is his longing for the beautiful youth something more innocent? Perhaps XXXXXX reminds him of what he could have been and now knows he never will be. Those who complain of the slow pace of this movie should stick to car crashes and kung-fu: at 2 hours and 15 minutes it's not particularly long, and it moves at a leisurely but hardly sluggish pace. The film benefits from the ravishing music of Gustave Mahler, on whom XXXXXXXXXX's character is clearly based. XXXX Bogarde gives a moving performance, and the movie is graced by the presence of XXXXXXX XXXXXXX, one of Italy's great beauties, as XXXXXX's mother.
