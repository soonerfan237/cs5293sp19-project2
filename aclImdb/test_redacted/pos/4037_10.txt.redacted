The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I have ever seen: much better and deeper than XXXXXXX's Romeo&Juliet or Spielberg's Titanic. Gerda's love impresses me every time, her search, her battle is exceptional. Gerda becomes a strong, loving woman throughout the movie. Kay is the poisoner of dark forces: the temptation. This story encourages me to fight like Gerda for the ONLY ONE, for the love of my life, for XXXXXX Right. Patience is one of the keywords of this movie. I cry every time when I realize all the suffering of Gerda and XXX. And I wish that it ends soon... XXXXXXXXX tells although my life, I deeply identify with the story and the characters. Thanks at least for XXXX Christian Anderson and the director.
