Blademaster is definitely a memorable entry in the Swords and Sorcery category of movies. I found Blademaster along with XXXXX for the Mighty Sword at a thrift shop attended by mentally handicapped people and was very happy to pay 2.00 each for them. Believable sets and costumes, good sword fighting and a beautiful female warrior, XXXX make this an enjoyable watch. A few problems though, there were a lot of details in the plot that didn't quite fit, like the cave men for one. I didn't understand their purpose. Also, this movie could have really benefited from some more monsters. The snake was cool, but I guess it does borrow a little from Conan. However, any primitive sort of movie where someone winds up with a hanglider is OK by me (see XXX and Battle for Endor). I think XXXX is cool! Oh, and was anyone else reminded of Gallager by the villain or is it just me? I give blademaster a 7/10
