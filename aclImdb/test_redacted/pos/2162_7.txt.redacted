Here is a much lesser known 50's sci-fi with a little different twist. An atomic researchers son is kidnapped and held for a ransom of the the Father's atomic secrets.<br /><br />This is a tightly knit atomic sci-fi thriller with great production values and above average acting, even from the kid. The XXXXXX XXXX actually has a movie feel to it unlike a lot of other 50's sci-fi of this time which which came off more like an episode of a TV show.<br /><br />The XXXXXX XXXX was also actually nominated for an XXXXXXX XXXXX for XXXX XXXXXXXXXX - how many other 50's sci-fi can tout an XXXXXXX XXXXX Nomination?<br /><br />Great pacing, tight direction and some superb location filming in the 'real' XXXXXX XXXX of Los Alamos, New Mexico make this one worth hunting down. The collectors print in circulation is an above average transfer and makes for a great double feature with the Atomic Man!! <br /><br />Recommended.
