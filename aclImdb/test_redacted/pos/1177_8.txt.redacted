XXXXXX XXXXXXX and XXXX XXXXXX, both of whom are sadly missed, proved once again that they were a team dedicated to their craft of bringing hilarious moments to the screen. This film is just another example of this.<br /><br />This time out they play two brothers-in-law who land on a ship as dance instructors on board.<br /><br />Of course, their boss is a perfectionist and miserable person named XXX XXXXXX who just enjoys harassing these boys. It's hilarious how XXXXXX gives a quick lesson in dancing to XXXXXXX and how the latter dances a riotous rumba with the boat's owner XXX McLanahan.<br /><br />Too bad that fellow dance instructors XXX XXXXXX and XXXXXX O'Connor are given so little to do but their parts call for that. XXXXXXX falls for XXXX XXXXXX, on board with her fellow gold-digging mother, the usual outrageous XXXXXX XXXXXXX. Unknown to them, XXXXXXX has no money either. The widower XXXXXX falls for XXXXXX XX XXXXX, looking lovelier than ever.<br /><br />The film belongs to XXXXXXX and XXXXXX and will serve as a further tribute to their illustrious careers.
