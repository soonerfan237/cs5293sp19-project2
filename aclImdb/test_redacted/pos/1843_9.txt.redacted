especially considering I can count on one hand the romantic comedy films I have ever enjoyed.<br /><br />XXXXXX XXXXXX is very good as the heart transplant patient, who has a mysterious connection to XXXXXXXX's recently deceased wife. (I can think of several awful films which have used this story line- I think there was an LMN movie with XXXX XXXXXXX) This film, however, is a keeper.<br /><br />XXXXXXXX is sympathetic, and the scenes with his dog are cute and sad- the dog misses his deceased wife. All of his friends want him to find a replacement, and there is an amusing scene where he is on a blind date and Driver is the waitress. His date is horrible, and he finds himself intrigued by XXXXXX XXXXXX.<br /><br />XXXXXX O'Connor is also good in one of his last roles, as the curmudgeonly grandfather. XXXXXX Hunt and XXXXX XXXXXXX (this is the only film I have liked him in) round out the comedy aspect of the film.<br /><br />This is a good film because the story works, it is not overly romantic, and does not insult the audience's intelligence. XXXXXX recommended 9/10.
