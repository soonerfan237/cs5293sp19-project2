True, this is not XXXX XXXXXX finest film (XXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXX XXXXXX) but it is not entirely forgettable either, if not for any other reason than its message. Like XXXXXX, XXXX XXXXX's parents were murdered in front of him, leaving him to fend for himself in 'The Zone,' a corrupt section of an unnamed city where greed and violence reign supreme. Instead of falling in with the likes of Chopper (XXXXXX XXXX) XXXX XXXXX fights for justice, using his powers of XXX XXX and eerie cat impressions, occasionally lighting himself on fire. He becomes something of an urban legend, a modern day XXXXX XXXX, and a hero for the ages. 1987 at its finest, WILD THING LIVES
