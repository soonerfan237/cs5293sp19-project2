I don't know why critics cal it bizarre and macabre. I really don't. XXXX -yes, bizarre - no. It i s sad and with lots of emotions, specially with the Pinguin's story. They say it has elements of S&M but I really don't find anything of that sort except for XXXXXXXX's whip.<br /><br />This movie is deeper than its genre and villains aren't just some crazy freaks dressed like on a masquerade. They have strong motives with strong feelings involved. Catwoman (a great performance by XXXXXXXX Pfeifer!) isn't just a sexy chick who likes steeling jewels - she's on her personal crusade and XXXXXXX... well, by the end of the movie you really feel sorry for him (strong performance by Danny DeVito). Again, I think XXXXXXX Keaton is the best Batman and he carries his costume well.<br /><br />You can totally see that it is a Tim Burton movie, because he has an unusual style and is a very talented guy. But also the music is fantastic and fits the emotions.
