I loved this movie the first time I saw it. It gives such detail of what executives involved in the news industry will do just to get a story on the air: notably XXXX XXXXX rushing XXXXX to finish editing the piece to get it off, and then XXXX XXXXXX struggling to get it in, and XXXXXXX XXXX, who according to XXXX commits an incredible breach of ethics, fakes his tears during his date rape interview, a flaw that is pointed out by XXXXX. Another high point is when XXX uses XXXX for his own benefits, and then turns around and sleeps with XXXXXXXX. The script is brilliant, and the directing is almost as good. All three main actors were great in the portrayals of their characters, XXXXXXXXXX XXXXX XXXXXX, and XXXXXX XXXXXX, whom is the funniest in the film. XXXXXXX XXXX is also very good. This deserved at least three Oscars, best actress(holly hunter), best supporting actor (XXXXXX XXXXXX), and best picture. I liked the last parts of the film where it shows them reuniting 7 years later.<br /><br />8/10
