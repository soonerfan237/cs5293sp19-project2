I've slowly been collecting the films available on DVD of both XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXX and XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX. Both actress and director have done some stinkers in their time - fortunately Mississipi Mermaid is not one of them.<br /><br />Next to "The Soft Skin", coincidentally staring XXXXXXX's sister (the late XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXX), this would have to be my favourite XXXXXXXX film.<br /><br />As well as directing, XXXXXXXX also wrote the screenplay. Something that always strikes me about XXXXXXXX is his almost childlike innocence when presenting a story -- one could almost call it naivety.<br /><br />There's a scene towards the end of the film where Belmondo returns to the apartment in Lyon with the remains of the loot. He rings the doorbell and XXXXXXX answers wearing a negligee. In the time it takes Belmondo to reach their room from the street, XXXXXXX changes into her dress, puts on her best pair of stockings and shoes, then lies on the bed and pretends she is asleep. It's a scene that could almost come from the mind of a child - but that's XXXXXXXX for you.<br /><br />Watching XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXX in her films of the late 60's is indeed a sensory pleasure. She is so extraordinarily beautiful it is almost painful for us to watch. Incidentally, for those fans, there are a couple of topless scenes of her in this film - indeed a sinful pleasure.<br /><br />I disagree with previous posters. I see nothing 'Hitchcockian' about the film at all. As for the 'look' of it - i love the look of the older film stock used in the 60's. It certainly gives films of this period a unique look.<br /><br />XXXXXX recommended for both XXXXXXX and XXXXXXXX fans......
