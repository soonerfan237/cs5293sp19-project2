The XXXXX XXXXXXXXX Story shows a little more about singer XXXXX XXXXXXXXX's complex life. Though it fails in giving accurate facts, and details.<br /><br />Cynthia Gibb (portrays XXXXX) was not a fine election. She is a good actress , but plays a very naive and sort of dumb XXXXX XXXXXXXXX. I think that the role needed a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality.<br /><br />XXXXXX XXXXXXXX role as XXXXX XXXXXXXXX is terrific, she does a great job as XXXXX's mother.<br /><br />It has great songs, which could have been included in a soundtrack album. Unfortunately they weren't, though this movie was on the top of the ratings in USA and other several countries
