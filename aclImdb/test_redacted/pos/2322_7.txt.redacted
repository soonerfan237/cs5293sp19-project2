It starts a little slow but give it a chance. In the spirit of the "Wackiest Ship in the Arm" and the "XXXX XXX" this movie is about a not so orthodox group engaged in not so orthodox methods to outwit everyone. XXX XXXXXXXXX is priceless as a LT that takes himself way too seriously which results in a failed mutiny attempt and "pirate" crew makes him walk the plank. In contrast XXXXXX XXXXXXX(similar to XXXX XXXXX)does not take anything to serious except the job. This movie is more about lines than plot. From the "beered up" fisherman in Charleston harbor to the "whale" decoy, their antics took me by surprise and I laughed out loud.
