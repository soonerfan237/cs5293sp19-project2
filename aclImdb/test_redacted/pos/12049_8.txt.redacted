XXXXXXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXXXX films have never disappointed. XXXXXXX Dulhania Le Jayenge is a romantic classic. Dil To XXXXX XXX was fresh and perfect to watch. Mohabbatein remains as one of my favorite movies ever. And Veer-Zaara was magical. XXXX, though not the best, is a romantic thriller that is different from the aforementioned movies, but definitely worth a watch. And SRK, who blew me away with an excellent performance in Baazigar, repeats a villain act. And this time he gets an experienced XXXX XXXXXX and XXXXX XXXX to support him.<br /><br />Before I comment on the acting, it is not just the acting, but the wonderful script that makes it worth a watch. It is the writing that compliments the great acting. The story is gripping, but the characterization is what stands out. The comedy track goes along well. But the movie has the tendency of shifting at romance too much. The viewer is bound to lose interest and you will make a couple of yawns. But the movie is still good.<br /><br />XXXXXXXX XXXX is brilliant in his author backed role. XXXXXXXX XXXX once again is sympathetic and cruel. You are bound to cry at the end. XXXX XXXXXX is decent. Her screams are bound to become annoying after a while. But in facial expression she is excellent. But her ending scene she is brilliant (though she was overshadowed by SRK). She has an author backed role that makes her very likable. XXXXX XXXX is adequate. His character was very likable, but too perfect. And it gets boring after a while. He does a good job though. XXXXXX Kher is really funny, but his role felt a little out of place. XXXXX Azmi supports well. <br /><br />The songs are enjoyable and come at the right time. XXXXX XXXX XXXXX (Magic At Your Sight) is my favorite song, and presentation is very 90's film like. Tu Mere Saamne (You are in Front of Me) and XXXXX XXX (XXXXXXX Here) are nice love songs. XXXXXXX Band Kar Lo (Close the Door) is a decent love song also. The instrumental song is danced to perfection as well as the naughty wedding song XXXXX XXXXXX. The movie may not be perfect, but it is well worth your time especially if your favorite actor is in it.
