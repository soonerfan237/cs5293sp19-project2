**SPOILERS**Actually based on the novel "The Brick Foxhole" about a gay man who was murdered by a GI on leave because of his sexual orientation. The movie "Crossfire" is about a violently anti-Semitic GI who because of his own failures and frustrations in life takes it out on those of the Jewish persuasion. Whom he obviously feels threatened by.<br /><br />Getting himself tanked up at a local ginmill in D.C barley sober US serviceman XXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXX XXXX, spots XXXXXX XXXXXX, XXX XXXXX, and starts to get a bit overly, yet sarcastically, friendly with him. It seems that XXXXXXXXXX is a bit ticked off at XXXXXXX because he's talking to his best friend and GI buddy XXXXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXXXX XXXXXX. XXXXXX is also getting through, which the Neanderthal XXXXXXXXXX can't, to the sensitive young GI who's into the arts, he's an artist and painter on the outside, about war, WWII the war that just ended. As well as the shaky peace, if that's what it is with the dawn of atomic bomb, that's now following it in this very dangerous and unstable world. What really outrages XXXXXXXXXX more then anything else about XXXXXXX is that he's obviously Jewish. That more then anything else is enough reason for the racist XXXXXXXXXX to want to do XXXXXXX in. <br /><br />XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX to join him and his lady friend XXXX. XXXXX, XXXXXX XXXXX, at his apartment to have a couple of drinks and continue the very deep and stimulating conversation that they started at the bar. This has a, what seems like, very jealous and feeling hurt and rejected XXXXXXXXXX together with his also inebriated but somewhat clueless, in what XXXXXXXXXX's plans for XXXXXXX are, friend and fellow GI Floyd Bowers ,XXXXX XXXXXX, later that night go uninvited to XXXXXXX' place. <br /><br />With the party already ended, with Mitchell and XXXX XXXXX gone, the two very drunk GI's unceremoniously crash the place. The fact that XXXXXXX, in XXXXXXXXXX's sick and anti-semitic mind, stole Mitchell away from him had him whip himself up into a white hot frenzy. XXXXXXXXXX and Bowers break into XXXXXX's home raiding his well stacked liquor cabinet with XXXXXXXXXX taking a couple of swigs, against XXXXXXX' strong objections, of XXXXXXX' very expansive and refined wines and spirits which is very unlike the watered down and cheap booze that the uncouth XXXXXXXXXX is used to guzzling. This all soon lead to a violent and brutal assault on XXXXXXX by the angry psychotic and drunk XXXXXXXXXX, with Bowers out cold on the sofa from all the liquor he consumed, who beats the poor and innocent man to death.<br /><br />The movie "Crossfire" then goes into a long and tedious, since it's obvious from the start who XXXXXXX' killer is, investigation into why XXXXXXX a wounded and decorated WWII veteran, who got the purple heart in the battle of Okinawa, was murdered with XXXXXXXXXX acting like he's really interested, yeah sure, in finding XXXXXXX' killer, which in reality is himself. This so-called voluntarily action on XXXXXXXXXX's part in order to throw off suspicion on himself that he may be the man who killed him. <br /><br />XXXXXXXXXX is so ridicules and even, for someone who smugly considers himself to be very smart, stupid in him constantly opening up his big yap and spewing out anti-semitic and racist epitaphs and slurs about the murdered XXXXXXX! That only throws suspicion on himself and no one else. I guess that guy just couldn't help it.<br /><br />It's not enough that XXXXXXXXXX murdered XXXXXXX who in his sick mind was one of "them" he even murders his friend the scared to death, in being implicated in XXXXXXX' murder, Bowers! Who in XXXXXXXXXX racist way of thinking is one of "us"! Just because he was afraid Bowers would talk to the police in order to save his own sorry neck and thus have the spotlight put on Montgomey in XXXXXXX' death. <br /><br />It doesn't take that long for the detective on the case Capt. XXXXXX, XXXXXX XXXXX, to see through XXXXXXXXXXs obvious lies and deceptions and then has him set up by having another GI "friend" of his Leroy (XXXXXXX XXXXXX), who was the butt of all his dumb and racist hillbilly jokes, set the arrogant creep up. This has XXXXXXXXXX coming back to the scene of his crime, where he murdered Bowers, where a trap has been set up for him. That was all Capt. XXXXXX needed to get XXXXXXXXXX to panic, when XXXXXXXXXX saw that the jig was up, and make a run for it straight into the crossfire of a police ambush.<br /><br />Dated a bit now but very hard-hitting back in 1947 when it was released. "Crossfire" addressed the horrors of anti-Semitism when it at the time was kept under the covers, and out of sight, in almost every post-WWII Hollywood movie about the evils of racism in the US, and in Europe. Even after the Second World War and with what happened to the Jews in it. When it should have been given the very full and honest exposer, to the movie going public, that it so rightfully deserved.
