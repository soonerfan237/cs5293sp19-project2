I have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of Coppola's masterpiece. I was lucky enough to meet XXXXXX XXXXX outside the Santa XXXXXX XXXXX Auditorium one night in 1981, as he waited for XXXXXXX and XXXXXX to leave a concert. He was very humble about the praise I shared with him for this work of art, especially his portrayal of the young Captain. This is, without a doubt, a must see, a complete 10 and an important part of American Film History. "XXXXXXX Don't Surf". XXXXXX XXXXXX's famous line (the other one) does not need repeating as it has become an oft repeated anthem and his Pattonesque character will long be remembered as a classic American war hawk in the XXXX XXXXX tradition. It is a surprise to see how young Laurence Fishburne looks.
