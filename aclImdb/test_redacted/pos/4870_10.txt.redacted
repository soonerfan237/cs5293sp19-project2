OK, so in any XXXX XX XXXXXX-Road Runner cartoons, we know that WEC is going to set up all sorts of traps for RR, but always maim himself in various ways. That certainly happens in "XXXX, XXXX". Predictable? I guess that it is, but when you think about it, these cartoons show how the more you try to harm someone else, the more you get harmed; sort of like how XXXXX XXXX always tries to undermine XXXX XXXXX's integrity but XXXX sees around it.<br /><br />Overall, this is another classic from the Termite Terrace crowd. Sometimes, I think that if we really had wanted to ease XXXX XXX tensions, we could have just let the Soviet Union see XXXXXX XXXXX cartoons; I'm sure that they would have loved them. Another great one.<br /><br />PS: I learned on "Jeopardy!" that XXXX XX XXXXXX's middle name is XXXXXXXXX.
