One of XXXXXX XXXXXXXXX's three greatest films, along with "Psycho" and "The 39 Steps", "Strangers On A Train" is as brilliantly out-of-control as a merry-go-round in Metcalf, and almost as deadly. It's the kind of film you have so much fun watching, you can't even feel properly guilty about it until you have time to catch your breath.<br /><br />Top amateur tennis contender XXX XXXXXX (XXXXXX XXXXXXX) meets a singularly weird, louche stranger named XXXXX XXXXXXX (XXXXXX XXXXXX) on a train. Thanks to the gossip pages, XXXXX knows all about XXX's problems with his no-good wife XXXXXX, and rather gaily suggests they do each other a favor: XXXXX will kill XXXXXX and XXX will kill XXXXX's father, who wants to put XXXXX in an institution. XXX laughs it off, but XXXXX ain't kidding, as XXX finds out to his peril.<br /><br />It's a great premise for a murder story, and XXXXXXXXX gives "Strangers On A Train" a run for all its worth, with the help of XXXXXX in perhaps the greatest performance in any XXXXXXXXX film, including XXXXXXX XXXXXXX in "Psycho". While XXXXXXX makes his mark playing tetchily against the grain, XXXXXX as XXXXXXX is one perfectly at home either buttering up old ladies at a swank dinner party or strangling a young woman at an amusement park.<br /><br />What drives XXXXX? Many commentators suggest his apparent homosexuality finds a match in pretty XXX. Yes, XXXXX lights up the old gay-dar, but XXX seems happy enough on love's rebound with socialite XXXX XXXXXX (XXXX XXXXX). XXXXX's interest for XXX could just as easily be envy, for someone making a mark in the world while he lives at home, letting XXXXX file his nails.<br /><br />"Oh, I certainly admire people who do things," XXXXX purrs, looking like a cat eyeing a mouse. "You know, it must be pretty exciting to be so important."<br /><br />Later on, XXXXX calls himself a "bum", accurate enough except for our rooting interest in him, even as he wrecks XXX's life with his homicidal meddling. It's the ultimate perverse underdog's tale. There's a sense of integrity about XXXXX, in his dogged dedication, which commands our respect and which XXXXXXXXX plays to so brilliantly. When XXXXX floats away from the scene of his big crime, am I the only sick person in this world who's actually happy for him? I think not, yet XXXXXXXXX keeps the story on a right-enough path for us to realize how low we have fallen. We don't want XXXXX to win, exactly, but we enjoy his Ã©lan as he tries.<br /><br />Everything else is so perfect, or at least close enough, to make every shot memorable. XXXXXXXXX always managed at least 2-3 good setpiece sequences per movie; here you get a score of them at the amusement park alone. ("20 Big Shows" the neon side at the entrance says, and they aren't kidding.) Script, camera-work, a gripping tennis match, XXXX XXXXX's jaw-dropping figure, it's all too much greatness for one film to contain. Even XXXXXXX does his callow-youth thing here with more risible plausibility than XXXXXXX XXXX ever managed.<br /><br />You can call this a clinic in movie-making, but "clinic" sounds too dull. "Strangers On A Train" is good nasty fun, all the way through, leaving you with a nifty stinger at the tail as you realize you were rooting for the wrong stranger all along. Heck, I'll take that ride over again in a second!
