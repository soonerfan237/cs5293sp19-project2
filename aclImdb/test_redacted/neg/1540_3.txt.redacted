From director XXXXXX Schroder (Reversal of Fortune), I think I saw a bit of this in my Media Studies class, and I recognised the leading actress, so I tried it, despite the rating by the critics. Basically cool kid XXXXXXX Haywood (Half Nelson's Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Bully's Michael Pitt) team up to murder a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without the police finding them. Investigating the murder is homicide detective XXXXXX 'The Hyena' Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) with new partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), who are pretty baffled by the evidence found on the scene, e.g. non-relating hairs. The plan doesn't seem to be completely going well because XXXXXX and Sam do quite quickly have Richard or Justin as suspects, it is just a question of if they can sway them away. Also starring XXXXX Bruckner as Lisa Mills, Chris Penn as Ray Feathers, R.D. Call as XXXXXXX Rod Cody and Tom Verica as Asst. D.A. XX Swanson. I can see now the same concept as XXX Alfred Hitchcock's Rope with the murdering for a challenge thing, but this film does it in a very silly way, and not even a reasonably good Bullock can save it from being dull and predictable. Adequate!
