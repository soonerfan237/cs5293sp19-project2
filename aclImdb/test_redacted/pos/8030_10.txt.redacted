I'm a huge fan of the spy genre and this is one of the best of these films. The Assignment is based on a true story, which has been somewhat embellished for the big screen, and it really takes you on a fun ride. The film has a great cast, starring XXXXX XXXXX, XXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX and XXX XXXXXXXX.<br /><br />XXXXX XXXXXXX XXXXX is a reluctantly recruited by Sutherland after a chance meeting with XXXXXXXX who believes XXXXX to be the famous terrorist XXXXXX the Jackal. Because XXXXX so closely resembles XXXXXX, Sutherland stops at nothing to recruit him because Sutherland is obsessed with the terrorist's capture or death.<br /><br />The training sequences are awesome. XXXXX is really put to the test by XXXXXXXX and Sutherland, having to withstand attacks from remote controlled snowmobiles, from eating the same food each day, to being drugged with a hallucinogen. He even has to learn how to make love to a woman the way XXXXXX would.<br /><br />The film has some great action scenes with XXXXX eluding allies because they believe he is XXXXXX and in his final mission when he is to kill the jackal. Throughout the film, XXXXX must struggle with the new personality he has attained versus his own. Will he remain as ruthless and free as XXXXXX or will he once again return to his life of a good husband and father? <br /><br />If you like the spy genre, this is a must see. The action is used only to propel the story of this thriller forward; no gratuitous explosions or fight scenes. Rating 10 of 10 stars.
