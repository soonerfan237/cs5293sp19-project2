"Christmas In Connecticut" is a gem of a Christmas movie classic. While lesser known than some others -- it is nonetheless a delightful way to spend an evening at holiday time. I watch it every year.<br /><br />XXXXXXX Stanwyck is perfectly cast as, Elizabeth Lane, the single, career girl. Way before it was popular, XXXXXXXX embodies the single girl on the rise. Her NYC apartment, and her friendly "uncle" restaurateur around the corner typify the single girl in the city existence. She can't cook yet she writes a homemaking column for a magazine!<br /><br />XXXXXX Morgan is also perfectly cast as our wartime hero, Jefferson Jones, who wants to meet the amazing Elizabeth Lane. After being lost at sea, all he wants is to spend XXXXXXXXX in a "real" home. Which sets up the delightful, madcap story that evolves. It is fun from beginning to end. We should all have an XXXXX Felix too!
