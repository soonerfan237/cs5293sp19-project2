The Standard bearer of all movie serials, the definite good guy - XXXXX XXXXXX - versus XXX XXX - Ming the Merciless. Though the special effects seem awful by today's standards, for 1936 they were top notch. But the essence of the story is the battle between Earthman XXXXX XXXXXX (XXXXXX XXXXXX) versus XXXXXXX XXXX of Mongo (XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX). XXXXXX and Middleton are terrific in their parts. And the supporting characters playing XXXX XXXXX, Dr. XXXXXX, Princess Aura, XXXXXX XXXXX, Vulcan, and the rest are all very good. This serial is far superior to the 1980 movie, basically because XXXXXX is much much superior to XXX XX XXXXX as XXXXX XXXXXX.<br /><br />This serial is the standard bearer for all movie serials. No question about it.
