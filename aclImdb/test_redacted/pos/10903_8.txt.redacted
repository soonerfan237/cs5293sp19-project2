IN & OUT, in my opinion, is a very hilarious movie. I thought that Cameron (XXXX Dillon) was wrong to say that Howard (Kevin Kline) was gay. The part I liked most was XXXXXX's bachelor party. This was because they were cracking jokes about a lot of things, including XXXXXX Streisand films. I also thought that Emily (Joan Cusack) looked very beautiful in her wedding dress and that XXXXXX looked good in his tuxedo. My favorite quote of IN & OUT is, "Is everybody gay? Is this 'THE TWILIGHT ZONE'?" That was absolutely hilarious! The one character I couldn't stand was Sonya (XXXXXX Harlow). This was because she was VERY conceited and snobby. In conclusion, I recommend this movie to all you XXXXX Kline fans who have not seen it. Be prepared to laugh HARD and have a good time when you see it.
