XXXXX Hood: Men in Tights (1993) was a much needed parody from Mel Brooks. He has the assignment of spoofing the XXXXX Hood legacy and the couple of movie dealing with the mythical honorable thief of English folklore. XXXX Elwes stars as Robin Hood. He's looking for a few good men who'll join him in his quest to topple the evil sheriff of Nottingham (XXXXX Rees) and win the fair hand of Maid Marian. XXXXX also has to deal with Prince John (Richard Lewis).as well. XXXXXX Ullman co-stars as Prince John's personal witch Latrine who has her eyes on the Sheriff.<br /><br />Will Robin find his merry men? How far will the Prince go to throw his weight around in the absence of his father? Why does the Sheriff hate XXXXX so much? To find out you'll have to watch ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS!! Check out the hilarious cameo by XXX De Luise who plays the Duke of Jersey.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
