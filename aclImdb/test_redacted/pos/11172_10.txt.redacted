XXXXXXX Kehoe has accomplished quite a feat, especially considering it is only his second start as writer, producer AND director. Generally "first timers" lack vision and direction when helming a major production but "Dominion" proves XXX Kehoe is going places in Hollywood! Set with beautiful scenery, Dominion boasts experienced cast members (especially XXXXXXXXX & James) who communicate Kehoe's vast vision with exceptional clarity. Few films can mix the slasher/horror genre with a genuine action/adventure feel, but XXXXXXXX accomplished this completely. This film certainly qualifies as one of the top-notch films in both of these categories. If you are looking for fast-paced action with more than a modicum of suspense, look no further. I look forward to XXXXX's future projects with great enthusiasm. Well done!!!
