I remember watching Police Squad! when it first came on ABC in 1982 and I thought it was a very funny show, thanks to the many sight gags, non sequitors and scripts filled with word play. In one episode, there was a line where a man named XXXX was shot twice. <br /><br />But unfortunately, ABC canceled the show after only six episodes. I felt it deserved a much longer run but a network executive thought the show demanded too much attention of the viewer because of all the sight gags in each episode. One that I remember was in the opening where the episode's title was different from the one shown on the screen. <br /><br />XXXXXX XXXXXXX's portrayal of XXXXX XXXXXX was deadpan, yet very funny and his role was in the narrative style of XXXX XXXX of Dragnet. XXXX North did well and XXXXX XXXXX, in one of his few roles since Mission: XXXXXXXXXX wasn't bad as Norberg, But the one character that stood out was XXXXXX the Shoeshine Boy, played by XXXXXXX XXXXX. After giving advice to Drebin, there were cameos from XXXX XXXXX, Dr. Joyce Brothers and then XXXXXX manager XXXXX XXXXXXX. <br /><br />Even though Police Squad! had a short life on ABC, the Zucker Brothers didn't give up on the concept which turned out even more successful in the Naked Gun movie franchise. I'll close with a regular closing gag. Freeze the ending right here.
