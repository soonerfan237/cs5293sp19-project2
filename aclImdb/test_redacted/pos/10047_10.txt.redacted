I saw this film over XXXXXXXXX, and what a great film it was! It tells the story of XXXXXX (played by XXXXX XXXXX) during and after his graduation from Westpoint. Although I've heard that the film isn't very historically accurate (Hollywood never is) I still enjoyed it as I knew little of the real events anyway.<br /><br />I thought XXXXX XXXXX was brilliant as XXXXXX and has since become my favourite actor! His acting alongside XXXXXX XX XXXXXXXXX was brilliant and the ending was fantastic! It brought me close to tears as he and XXX XXXXX (XXXXXX XXXXXXX) rode to their deaths on little big horn.<br /><br />I had always known that XXXXX XXXXX was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and I grew up watching his films as a child. But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.<br /><br />I'll give this film 10 out of 10!!
