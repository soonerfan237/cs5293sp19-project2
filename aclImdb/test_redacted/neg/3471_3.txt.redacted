"XXXXXXXX Nero" is the second movie of the series of six productions named "XXXXXXXX". I have already unfavorably commented the first one: "XXXXXXXX Augustus". This second TV movie produced and broadcast last weekend by the Italian state owned network has the same defects. In addition contains a considerable number of historical errors. Some examples: XXXX is a child and Agrippina calls him: "XXXX, XXXX". At that time is name was XXXXXXXX. He was named XXXX after his adoption. XXXX did not meet Acte when he was young as in the movie but after his marriage with Octavia and his nomination to Emperor. When becoming Emperor his sons where not adults: Britannicus is one month old and Octavia one year old. And many many more. If you are fond of ancient roman history you can find yourselves other examples. "Imperium" series will continue with four more movies : "Titus", "XXXXXX Aurelius","Costantinus" and"The Fall of the Roman Empire". Finally!
