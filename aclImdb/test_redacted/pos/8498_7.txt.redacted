If someone had nudged me about 15 minutes into 'XXX' and asked what I thought of XXXXX XXXX in the title role, it would have been time for a blank stare. After all, what is this (fictitious) person talking' about? That wasn't XXXXX XXXX up on the big screen. That was XXX XXXXXXX. This is one of the best performances by anybody in recent years. Like the soundtrack, XXXXX as XXX is flat-out brilliant.<br /><br />The blind Genius of Soul (who took a revolutionary step of mixing gospel with R&B) died during production. The movie about his troubled life is good, not great. XXXXXX Hackford's direction and XXXXX XX XXXXX's script follow the well-worn biopic outline. Super-talented youngster battles adversity, achieves greatness while also self-destructing, then picks himself up out of the gutter for a happy ending. The film shows XXXXXXX' flaws (heroin abuse, chronic womanizing, persistent bastard-fathering) even as it sucks you in with his beautiful music.<br /><br />XXXXX XXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXX XXXX play the main women in XXX's life, one his long-suffering wife and the other his longtime mistress. Both actresses match XXXX stride for stride. What takes him to a different level, though, is his deep understanding and uncanny impersonation of the great musician. The entire cast is effective, especially XXXXXX XXXXXX as his headstrong mother and XXXXXX XXXXXXXXX as a music exec. Hackford's stars are likely to be rewarded with trophies and---better yet---more starring roles.<br /><br />I was not a XXX XXXXXXX aficionado before 'XXX'. Apparently, the film has left out a lot (as do all biopics), but this picture functions as both an old-fashioned crowd pleaser AND a dark investigation of a brilliant/troubled man. For those who whine that XXXX doesn't actually sing (as if that somehow diminishes his performance), take a hike. No mere actor can sing like Mr. XXXXXXX anyway. You can't have everything. What the talented star does in this picture is about as close to "everything" as we'll probably see for a while.
