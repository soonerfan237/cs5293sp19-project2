Although little more than a pleasant 11-minute musical diversion (it's rightly billed as a "XXXXXXX XXXXXXX") EVERY Sunday is one of the most famous and precious documents in cinematic history, since it provides an invaluable look at the burgeoning talents of two of the screen's most talented and beloved musical performers: XXXXXX XXXXXX and XXXX XXXXXXX.<br /><br />Although often cited as an screen test of sorts, produced by MGM to test the adolescent appeal of studio contractees XXXXXX and XXXXXXX whose options were reportedly coming up for renewal, this assertion is not entirely accurate. By the time EVERY Sunday was produced in July, 1936, XXXXXX XXXXXX's contract with MGM had already lapsed and she had been immediately signed by XXXXXXXXX a month earlier, in June 1936.<br /><br />However, a provision in XXXXXX's MGM contract permitted the studio to exercise an option on her services for up to sixty days, providing she had not yet begun work on a picture at her new studio. As XXXXXX's debut vehicle, THREE SMART GIRLS, was still not ready to begin filming, MGM chose to exercise its' option and, although officially under contract to XXXXXXXXX at the time, XXXXXX found herself back on the MGM lot filming this agreeable short subject with fellow adolescent singing hopeful, XXXX XXXXXXX.<br /><br />This, along with XXXXXXX's far more extensive prior professional performing experience/training (which included appearances in several earlier movie shorts), may explain why EVERY Sunday often seems to favor XXXX XXXXXXX over XXXXXX XXXXXX, giving XXXXXXX more lines to speak and an original song ("Americana") to sing, while XXXXXX offers the popular classical art song, "Il Bacio" by XXXXX XXXXXXX. Certainly, it would make perfect sense that MGM would want to favor one of its' own contract players over another from a rival studio.<br /><br />Ironically, although XXXXXXX's character is the more overtly pro-active one of the two girls in this short, it would be XXXXXX's feisty and impulsive "Little Miss Fixit" screen persona at XXXXXXXXX which would propel her to instantaneous worldwide super stardom as the world's first "Teen Idol" with her debut vehicle, THREE SMART GIRLS, while XXXXXXX's more passive "wistful wallflower" adolescent image would see her generally cast in supporting roles opposite frequent screen partner XXXXXX XXXXXX and (in ZIEGFELD GIRL) the up-and-coming XXXX XXXXXX. Not until her fifteenth MGM feature, 1942' FOR ME AND MY GAL (which was also her first fully "adult" role) would XXXXXXX achieve the solo above-the title billing and "solo attraction" status of a true superstar that XXXXXX had attained instantaneously six years earlier.<br /><br />It is entirely inaccurate, therefore, to assert that XXXXXXX was the only "superstar" attraction of the two girls, as XXXXXX attained this status with press 'n public, almost a decade before her MGM rival. Literally in foreclosure at the time of her signing, the on screen evidence strongly suggests that XXXXXXXXX was much quicker to realize XXXXXX's full superstar potential than MGM was with XXXX, and it's worth noting that almost every notable accomplishment XXXXXXX achieved at MGM, from superstar billing, to having starring vehicles specially written to showcase her talents and appeal, to being invited to plant her footprints in the forecourt of Graumann's Chinese Theater, to receiving an "Honorary" Oscar" in recognition for her talent, XXXXXX XXXXXX received well before her gifted MGM contemporary.<br /><br />In any case, EVERY Sunday is a delightful, utterly unpretentious musical short. Its plot line (XXXXXX and XXXXXXX use their singing talents to save XXXXXX's grandfather from being forcibly retired by the town council from conducting his Sunday concerts in the park), presages the plot lines of both XXXXXXX's "Let's Put On a Show" musicals with XXXXXX XXXXXX and XXXXXX's 100 MEN AND A GIRL. Unlike XXXXXXX's later BABES films, the short never treats the insubstantial storyline seriously, and consequently, its' eleven minute running time flies by.<br /><br />Of course, the true magic of EVERY Sunday is in observing the already remarkable performing talents/screen presences of XXXXXX and XXXXXXX at the very beginning of their legendary careers. Both girls, even at this early stage, possessed remarkable screen presences and are utterly natural and unaffected in their presentation as both singers and actresses. XXXXXXX fairly explodes off the screen with vitality as she literally punches out the lyrics to the jaunty "Americana." As she socks across the number with appropriate hand gestures, XXXX literally seems to be chewing on the words of the song as she screws up her mouth and bugs out her eyes in her intense eagerness to show what she can do.<br /><br />By contrast, XXXXXX's presentation of "Il Bacio," is far more demure and subdued. Although entirely appropriate for her "classical" selection, XXXXXX's delivery of Arditi's waltz is much more of the traditional "stand 'n sing" variety than XXXXXXX's physically emotive turn. Nevertheless, though "miniature diva" XXXXXX does nothing to call attention to herself, with her candid eyes, dazzling smile and artless delivery, she easily holds the screen with "jazz baby" XXXX, and their delightful duetting of "Americana" in the short's finale makes one regret all the more that producer XXX XXXXXXXXX was never able to realize his dream of pairing XXXXXX and XXXXXXX in a musical feature film (because XXXXXXXXX refused to loan "Number One Asset" XXXXXX out).<br /><br />A priceless document of the nascent talents of two remarkable and utterly unique talents. See this one if you get a chance!
