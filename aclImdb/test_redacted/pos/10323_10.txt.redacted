"Gargle with old razor blades. Can I help it if I'm not cousin XXXXX? I think the piano's out of tune. XXXXXX Grey. This is your little snookums." Laughs throughout the entire 20 minute short as the boys spoof gold diggers and opera singers. They even manage to show us how to properly demonstrate to some attractive ladies how to handle both a rifle and a bear trap. Wonder how many times they rehearsed the scene with the phone booth. Adding XXXXXXXXX McIntyre and Emil Sitka, 2 frequent collaborators, to the mix makes it even better. Only XXXXXX Dent is missing. The XXXXXXX did some great individual scenes, but this was their best overall.
