Why do people need to follow the opinion of the herds of masses and critics? RANDOM HEARTS, directed by the brilliant XXXXXX XXXXXXX (who has a small role in the film too) is another XXXXXXXX XXXX vehicle. As such, it is quite good and entertaining. Surely, anyone who goes to see it has this in mind, or read the book which is no better. Even XXXXXXX XXXXX XXXXXX fans, myself included, knew it would be a variation of her again playing the love interest of her eldest uncle. Even as such, the film is satisfying. What's so bad about this movie that is much better in the other (much higher rated) XXXXXXXX XXXX vehicles? This film is no masterpiece, but it's not as bad as the masses would have the potential viewer believe.
