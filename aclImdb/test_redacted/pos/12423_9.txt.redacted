Great horror comedy from XXXXXXX Davis.Iwas laughing so hard i almost peed! Great acting from XXXX Jungman as the good guy who saves the day & great performance by the Jack Black-esquire like performance from Justin Urich. He was just divine in this film. This guy deserves to be a big star. Also,XXXXX Brooks was good in the film as well as the girl in danger along with the guys from a killer reminiscent of Jeepers Creepers. The gore to was given in copious amounts & i loved it.I just hope they release a not rated version. Great low-budget XXXXXX Comedy. The dead cat in the hotel sex scene is just gruesomely funny! ***** out of *****
