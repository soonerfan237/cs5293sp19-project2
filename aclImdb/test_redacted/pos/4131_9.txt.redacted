XXXX Busey is superb in this musical biography. Great singing and excellent soundtrack. The Buddy Holly Story is a much better movie than XX Bamba. From reading other comments, there may be some historical inaccuracies. Regardless, it is a fun toe-tapping film, and a good introduction to XXXXX Holly's music.
