exquisite!! in simple words... both XXXXXX Sen and Konkona Sen seem to understand each other quite well or maybe they both are just too good.this might just be her best performance as an actor and XXXXXX's best as a director. yeah maybe better than Mr and XXX Iyer. Konkona plays the role of a schizophrenic. XXXXXXX Azmi plays the role of Anjali,Mithi's(Konkona Sen's) elder sister. XXXXXXX Azmi made the best out of Anjali's character for she had to play a strong,responsible,arrogant role of an elder sister who had the full responsibility of her family. XXXXXX Sen has beautifully crafted Anjali's character,a strong woman who had to sacrifice her personal life,her love for her family.<br /><br />Mithi's behavior was'not juvenile at all,for you can expect this from most of Indian directors for this role.looks like a lot of research has been done to understand the role of Mithi,a schizophrenic. When at times XXXXX is a normal,sweet college going girl,she also scares you when she is shown ill..both the sides have been beautifully judged and played..believe me it at times reminds you of the girl in Exorcist..not that scary though.. Overall..Marvellous piece of work by XXXXXX Sen,Konkona Sen and Shabana Azmi...
