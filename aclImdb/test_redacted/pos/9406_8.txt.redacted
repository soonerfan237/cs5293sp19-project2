This great TV movie told of the 1975 murder of XXXXXX XXXXXX in Greenwich, Connecticut by a nephew of XXXXX XXXXXXX. The use of the "ghost" of XXXXXX to provide some of the details was very effective and added a lot of heart to the story. XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXX seemed to capture the personality of XXXX XXXXXXX very well. Furhman, who got so much underserved bad publicity in the O.J. Simpson trial has certainly vindicated himself by his contribution of bringing the killer to justice after about 27 years.
