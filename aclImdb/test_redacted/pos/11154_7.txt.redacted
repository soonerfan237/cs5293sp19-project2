Like a lot of stars of the big screen as their careers wound down, so many turned to television where probably they secured their reputations for posterity. XXXXX Reed is a case in point.<br /><br />I don't think XXXXX Reed ever thought that XXXXX Stone was anything challenging, not to a woman who had won an Oscar for playing a very different type in From Here to Eternity. She was certainly better prepared to play wife, mother, and homemaker XXXXX Stone after having played XXXX XXXXXX in It's A Wonderful Life. <br /><br />XXXXX was always beautiful and wise and ever helpful with the problems of her kids and her husband. XXXX XXXX was not an idiot, he was a pediatrician who had his office attached to the house. Talk about the man being ever ready in a crisis.<br /><br />Though this was the XXXXX Reed Show because XXXXX's husband at the time, XXXX XXXX produced it. Yet it lasted as long as did because of the popularity of the two children, XXXXXXX XXXXXXX and XXXX XXXXXXXX. XXXXXXX had that best selling teen record XXXXXX XXXXX which she introduced on the show. She successfully made the transition to adult star, most known for her role in Coach as XXXXX XX XXXXXX's wife.<br /><br />But XXXXXXXX was a bubblegum teen idol back in the day. The XXXXX Reed Show dare I say got most of its viewers because of him. It's forgotten now, but XXXXXXXX also had a best selling record, XX XXX. Didn't do half as well as XXXXXX XXXXX. <br /><br />Now XXXX XXXXXXXX runs a support group for former child stars like himself. So many of them end so tragically, it's good work that he's doing. <br /><br />The Stone family was the quintessence of Middle America. They lived in a suburb near Chicago, they led wholesome lives. Mom and XXX were always there for the kids. Of course the problems they had usually were nothing more than breaking curfew. <br /><br />It's this series I believe was the model for the TV town of Pleasantville where XXXXX XXXXXXX and XXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX are sucked into. <br /><br />I have pleasant memories of The XXXXX Reed Show. Easy to take, but not too seriously.
