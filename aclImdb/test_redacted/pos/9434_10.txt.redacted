The evil Professor Moriarty plots to gain control of both SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE SECRET WEAPON which could win the war for the Nazis.<br /><br />Basil XXXXXXXX & XXXXX XXXXX return to the screen as XXX XXXXXX XXXXX XXXXX's beloved detective and sidekick, Sherlock XXXXXX & Dr. XXXXXX, in this entertaining little mystery. XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXX wasted no money on either fancy production values or a sensible script, knowing that its two stars would be all the attraction an audience would need. Indeed XXXXXXXX, as the cerebral ego, and XXXXX, as the bumbling id, seem to actually become the characters they are creating, gleefully keeping their faces straight while engaged in the most utter nonsense.<br /><br />XXXXXX XXXX makes his first appearance as the dogged Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard; teamed with XXXXX, these two good-hearted but pedantic fellows actually get to save the intellectually superior XXXXXX' life twice. XXXXXX Atwill, a master of the sinister who deserves more recognition for his talent, does a fine job as Moriarty, making the wicked rascal a foe worthy of XXXXXX' steel, relishing the scenes in which he gets to inflict torture & pain.<br /><br />XXXXXXX XXXX Jr. and XXXXXX XXXXX play the Swiss scientist and his girlfriend who are at the heart of the mystery, but they're not given much to do. XXXXX XXXX XXXXXX makes a token appearance as XXXXXX' landlady Mrs. Hudson.<br /><br />XXXXXXXX spices up his already classic interpretation of XXXXXX by getting to appear in disguise three times during the story, thereby revealing to the viewer that the great sleuth was a bit of a ham actor at heart.<br /><br />This film--which is based very loosely on elements in Sir XXXXXX's short stories 'The Dancing XXX' and 'The XXXXX XXXXX'--followed SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE VOICE OF TERROR (1942) and preceded SHERLOCK HOLMES IN WASHINGTON (1943).
