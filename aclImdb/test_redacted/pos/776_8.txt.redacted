"Driving XXXXXXX" sees two middle class quintessential British families meet head on, when XXXXX's character comes into contact with XXXX, (Walters), a slightly deranged out-of-touch actress with an ego. XXXXX betrays his overpowering, and over-Christian mother, (XXXXXX), and goes off travelling with XXXX to Scotland, to accompany her on a trip to participate in a Poetry reading, something she claims could be her last, due to an illness.<br /><br />XXXXX's portrayal of a caged youngster, brainwashed by an overbearing, and even hypocritical mother, is the masterpiece of this film. His portrayal of a downtrodden teen in search of his true morals, and happiness, is captivating to watch unfold throughout. The film is sharply shot, and well paced, with very few moments leaving you tired, an achievement, particularly considering the nature of the plot. Walters really grabs hold of her character with both hands, and successfully brings the audience to her side of things, emphasising XXXXXX's ironic immorality throughout. Her role in "Driving XXXXXXX" is enjoyable and memorable in every sense.<br /><br />The plot develops nicely, leaving the audience cheering on XXXXX as he chases back to XXXX's place during his lunch break during his stint at a local bookshop to apologise for his wrongdoings. The values in the piece are continued and brought out thoroughly up until the final drag, in a very consistent way. The overbearing, (and relieving), main idea being that religion doesn't lead to happiness, and certainly doesn't lead to morality.<br /><br />The audience are left sympathising with the radical but lovable XXXX, with her and XXXXX making an irresistible partnership on the big screen, transferred directly from their debut in the "XXXXX XXXXXX" series. Charismatic and beautiful acting together with a tight and fact paced script make this a must-see this Christmas.
