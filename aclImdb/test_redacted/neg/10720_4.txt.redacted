Unfortunately this is not as good as any of the other films that XXX Carrey (producing and starring) and Brian Grazer have worked on together, but bits of it are definitely worth a look for laughs. XXXXXXXXX Dick Harper (Carrey) thinks he is being promoted to a better job. That's until the company of Dynocorpe sinks and closes down. Now XXXX and his wife Jane (TÃ©a Leoni), and their son of course, are in trouble with money. No matter what they try, they can't raise the kind of money they really want. So they start robbing a few places. And then they decide to rob the guy that set XXXX up, his ex-boss Jack McAllister (Alec Baldwin). I think the most laughable bits are when XXXXXX's in the elevator singing "I Believe I Can Fly" and the bit when he ties up someone in a robbery, and is speaking with a voice changer (he sounds like a crap robot). Okay!
