Rendition presents a very topical matter in the form of a very tense thriller. It's a gripping, and not a preaching, movie. Seeing it in an XXXX country with a mixture of XXXXian and European audience gave it an extra level of atmosphere. The audience was totally gripped by the film and gave it a loud applause afterwards. The story of an Egyptian, married to an American, picked up on the suspicion of links to terrorist organizations and shipped to a friendly (with US) XXXX country for "enhanced interrogation (as XXXXX XXXXXX's character states in the film: "we have no torture in the US") seems to be from the front page of todays news. There is a very neat link between the various characters which appear in the movie and the pace of the film never drops. The movies'message seems to be (as stated by XXXX XXXXXXXXX's character in the film) that by abducting and torturing suspects you create many more terrorists. The acting is uniformly excellent with XXXXXX and XXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX the stand outs. Not to be missed.
