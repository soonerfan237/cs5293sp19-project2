Almost no cinema experience can beat a good thriller with a sense of humor. XXXXX Davis is a schoolteacher housewife who suffers from amnesia. She'e even on the PTA! But then an auto accident awakens the woman she used to be, and it's HOT! XXXXXX L. Jackson is hilarious as the low rent private eye who tries to help Davis find her past, only to find out he's in way over his head. XXXXX has some hilarious lines too, and the interaction between her and Jackson works surprisingly well.<br /><br />Look for Brian Cox, the original Hannibal Lechter, and David Moorse finally managing to shed his St. Elsewhere TV image. The film is directed by XXXXX' husband, who almost seems to have built the whole film around her, but it works.<br /><br />I pull out this DVD and rewatch it often. I still love the makeup scene. Is XXXXX hot or what?
