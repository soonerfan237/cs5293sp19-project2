This is the middle cartoon of the three (between XXXXXX XXXX and XXXX! Rabbit, XXXX!) and is the weakest of the three, while still being quite funny. It simply depends on one gag for too much of the action. Still a good cartoon. I feel a definite sympathy for XXXXX in this one, which is rare for me. XXXXX is so clearly overmatched that it almost becomes painful to watch at times. Good cartoon in an excellent series. Recommended.
