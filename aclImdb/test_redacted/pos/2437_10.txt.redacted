It was a sweet, intro for the most intelegent XXXXXX Soldier, XXXXXX Mercury. It consisted with a new "in croud", Merciurios. He, at the beganing wrote a love letter to XXX, which would be starltling (of course) and, now, XXX thiks he is a chibi-Einstien, and he is attractive (He ended up looking like Umino (Melvin)). This was a halarios (expesialy XXXXXX's "It's no skin off my neck" scene (HOT!)) Well, I really like the Bishojo Senshi XXXXXX Moon Series, I personally think its the best anime ever!, But, this movie was nice, funny, but not as adventurios as XXXXXX Moon R- It was more like the "S" movie. I saw this @ Sailor XXXX Univewrse, with real Player, and it was pretty good. (Over all)
