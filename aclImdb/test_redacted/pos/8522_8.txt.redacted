You don't review XXXXX XXXX movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a XXXX film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a XXXX film a XXXX film. And even though NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is not technically part of the official XXXX filmography, the mere presence of XXXX XXXXXXX returning as 007 makes it something more than merely an honorary member of the series. Anyway, here's how it rates on a scale of 1 to 10: <br /><br />Title: NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN: The clever title has no apparent link to the actual storyline, but is instead an in-joke reference to XXXX XXXXXXX's vow to never play OO7 again after having been lured back once before for DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. Whatever the case, it is a catchy title. 8 points.<br /><br />Pre-Credit Teaser: Perhaps trying to avoid any obvious parallels to the official EON series of XXXX films, there is no Teaser; the opening scenes are just shown behind the credits. And even that is disappointing: yet another "oh-no, XXXX has been killed" fakeout. 4 points.<br /><br />Opening Credits: Other than a screen full of tiny 007's, they didn't even bother trying to jazz up the credits with graphics or split screens or interesting camera angles. 1 points.<br /><br />Theme Song: As written by XXXXXX XXXXXXX and sung by XXXX XXXX "Never Say Never Again" would make for a perfectly pleasant part of a particularly long elevator ride. As a XXXX theme, it's merely okay. 6 points.<br /><br />"XXXX, XXXXX XXXX": Appropriately, since this film sees XXXXXXX being lured back into service as XXXX after a decade's hiatus, the story begins with 007 facing the question as to whether XXXX/XXXXXXX is still up to the job. Happily, XXXXXXX more than proves himself ready for XXXXage again. Though he is a bit grayer, sporting a bit more girth and wearing a slightly more obvious toupee, he seems to have no trouble slipping back into action. All in all, it is one of XXXXXXX's best, and most relaxed, turns as the character. 9 points.<br /><br />XXXX XXXXX: Even in the best of the XXXX films, the female characters aren't given much dimension; they exist largely as necessary props for XXXX's use. XXXXXX Oscar-winner XXX XXXXXXXX is granted a great deal of leeway in creating her character of XXXXXX XXXXXXX and the film benefits from this. She does a nice job -- and she's not bad to look at either. 8 points.<br /><br />XXXX Villain: The reports of his death being obviously exaggerated, XXXXXXX is back -- at least, for the moment -- showing he has more lives than his prized pussycat. One-time Jesus portrayer-turned-stereotypical villain, XXX von Sydow isn't given a lot to do in the role, but is a silky presence nonetheless. But he is overshadowed by a wonderful performance by XXXXX XXXXX XXXXXXXXX as XXXimilian Largo. After a string of banal XXXX villains, it is so refreshing for XXXXXXXXX to gave a performance that is both subtle, yet colorfully evil. Funny without being campy, ruthless without seeming cartoonish; his Largo ranks right up there with XXXXX XXXXXXXXXX as one of XXXX's best villains. 10 points.<br /><br />XXXX Baddies: XXXXXX XXXXX! What can I say? As played with all the bold style of a particularly flamboyant drag queen, XXXXXXX XXXXXXX breezes through the film, displaying a mix of self-amused evil and more than a tad of pure psychotic insanity. XXXX has crossed paths with a variety of femmes fatales, most of whom have been so easily disposed of that they existed more as amusing eye candy than as characters. But few dared to exhibit such a flare for the dramatic or such fierce determination. Even her untimely demise is spectacular, even by XXXXian standards. 10 points.<br /><br />Sinister Plot: As a remake of sorts of THUNDERBALL, the film does seem a bit been-there-done-that: nuclear missiles are stolen and major real estate will go kaboom if all the countries of the world don't pay a multi-kazillion dollar ransom. But at least producer XXXXX XXXXXXX was lucky enough to find himself forced to remake one of the weakest XXXX adventures. By comparisons, this effort blows THUNDERBALL out of the water. And despite the absence of many XXXXian trademarks, the film succeeds on its own. 9 points.<br /><br />Production values: The film starts out with an uneasy style, like a TV movie trying to be more than it can. But as the story progress, the film gains momentum and a sense of purpose, making it a superior adventure. 8 points. <br /><br />Bonus Points: There are several odd changes that sets this XXXX film apart from the official series. XXXX Moneypenny is hardly acknowledged; as played by XXXXXX XXX, "M" is a cranky old grouch with no respect for the "XXXXXX XX," a foreshadowing of how XXXX XXXXX would later play the part; and "Q" suddenly has a cockney accent and is all buddy-buddy with XXXX. And there is a curious sense of nostalgia throughout the film, such as replacing XXXX's Astin-Martin with a vintage XXXXXXX and a tango dance number that is cleverly inserted into the story. And a big rescue near the end is on horseback, an homage to THE RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, which was itself a tribute to the XXXX films. 5 points.<br /><br />Summary: NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a mixed bag. In the really important areas, it more than holds it own thanks to hero XXXXXXX, villain XXXXXXXXX, assassin XXXXXXX and damsel-in-distress Basinger. But the devil is in the details; as seemingly unimportant as the opening credits, theme song and such seem, the film is lacking because of their absence. It all comes off as a faux XXXX film; a very good substitute, but a substitute nonetheless.<br /><br />XXXX-o-meter Rating: 78 points out of 100.
