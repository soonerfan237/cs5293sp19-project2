XXXXX XXXXXX starts in '1968' as a young XXXX XXXXXX (XXXXX XXXXXXX) is unexpectedly handed the family tradition of becoming a XXXXXXX hunter when a fellow XXXXXXX hunter XXX O'Mack (XXX Haim) betrays his family & hands them over to the XXXXXXX's, to aid XXXX on his quest he is given a book that contains the name of every XXXXXXX alive, or dead whichever way you look at it... Jump to 'June 1995' & Los Angeles where the now adult XXXXXX (XXX 'The XXXXXX' XXXXXX, also credited as co-producer) has but four names left in the book including, Argento (Vince Murdocco) & Carmella (Sophia Crawford) together they are the last of the American XXXXXXXs. As they all dine in a restaurant XXXXXX crashes the party & kills them, job done right? Wrong as King of the XXXXXXXs Bruno Fischer (XXXXXXXX XXXXX) calls in the last four remaining XXXXXXXs from around the world, the French Tournier (XXXXX XXXX), the Asian Hashimoto (XXX XXXX), Ulmer (XXXXX 'Shark Fralick) & Sangster (Vincent Klyn) to track XXXXXX down & kill him. Meanwhile XXXXXXXXX's Hooper (XXXXXX XXXXXXXX) & Browning (Cash Casey) don't have a clue & a nosey reporter named XXXXX XXXXX (XXXXXXX XXXXX) becomes involved in the battle between XXXXXX & the XXXXXXX's on which the very fate of Earth rests!<br /><br />Directed by XXXX XXXXXXXX I thought XXXXX XXXXXX was quite a fun way to pass 85 odd minutes. The script by XXXXXXX XX XXXXXXX mixes martial arts & horror with a fair degree of success, it moves along at a nice pace & is at least never boring & thankfully doesn't seem to take itself too seriously. The character names that reference other horror film director's/actors are a little tacky though. Some may be surprised at how closely XXXXX XXXXXX resembles XXXXX (1998) yet was made a couple of years prior, the lone moody long coat wearing XXXXXXX hunter who happens to be an expert in martial arts, the scene set in a nightclub & the innocent woman drawn into the world of XXXXXXX's. XXXXX XXXXXX doesn't really stick to traditional XXXXXXX film law, for instance sunlight only irritates their eye's, they can only breed on a solar eclipse (why?), stakes through the heart & garlic is no good as the way to kill a XXXXXXX in XXXXX XXXXXX is to break it's neck. I could have done with a bit more horror & a bit more blood as it leans more towards the martial arts side of things. The dialogue is suitably cheesy & the character's are just about likable enough in a silly way.<br /><br />Director XXXXXXXX does his best to ruin the film, the actions scenes are OK but lack a certain something & for some bizarre reason whenever an action sequence takes place he shakes his camera constantly, it's like the camera is placed upon a washing machine full cycle! XXX Rick, mate, it's not clever or stylish it's irritating & annoying. The gore is disappointing with a few gory gunshot wounds & a few splashes of blood, breaking XXXXXXX's necks don't involve much blood unfortunately.<br /><br />With a budget that probably didn't amount to much XXXXX XXXXXX is competently made throughout. The acting was bad most of the time & what's with 'The XXXXXX' thing in XXX 'The XXXXXX' XXXXXX's name? Has he legally changed his name? Does he sign cheques XXX 'The XXXXXX' XXXXXX?! Does he get mail addressed to him in that name? I think I might do something like this, from now on I want to be known as XXXX 'The XXXXXX XXXXX' Andrews...<br /><br />XXXXX XXXXXX is one of those crap films that transcends it's limitations & awfulness to become pure golden entertainment. If you like your films fun then XXXXX XXXXXX might be for you, if your looking for big-budget thrills in a similar vein (! XXXXXXX's, veins & blood get it?) then XXXXX & it's sequels would probably be a better choice. What the hell, I liked it so sue me.
