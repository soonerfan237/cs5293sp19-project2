This is the follow-up creation to XXXXXX Off Dead. In a competition, XXXXXX Off Dead would win hands-down. But for star power, One Crazy Summer outshines XXXXXX Steve's better script. Problems with One Crazy Summer (OCS): casting. XXXXXX Off Dead (BOD) was cast so much better. Friendship: OCS shows Cusack giving hateful looks to XXXX Murray's little bro. Trouble on the set?? More outrageous friends in OCS, but more genuine friends in BOD. XXXX was good. You'll predict some of it, but even the predictable parts go further than you think they could. So, even though this is Better Off Dead's ugly stepsister, it's worth a look. See XXXX Moore before the plastic surgery if for no other reason. XXXX Cusack fans, you gotta see it, just to say you have. If you don't like XXXXXX Golthwaite, I'm sorry. I don't like him either, but you can't escape him in this one. At least he does a great job in the film doing a tribute to another movie monster. Editing needed help on the beach, but for most part, not much to complain about. Overall, it's good and funny. But try not to compare it to BOD or you'll find it lacking. *sigh*
