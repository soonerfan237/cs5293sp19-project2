Um, hello.. XXXXXXX Brite.. the name alone is hard to take it seriously, like she could be the cousin of Strawberry Shortcake.. but when you're a kid, this is definitely serious stuff.<br /><br />So, there's this vile, snotty, spoiled girl and she wants XXXXXXX Brites belt, amongst other things, ie the light of the whole universe, and XXXXXXX Brite and her friend Cris are bound and determined to stop her. As I remember, XXXXX and Lurky had a minor role in this production. Maybe they wanted too much money?<br /><br />So anyway, snotty, evil girl has a powerful jewel and she channels it's power to take XXXXXXX's belt.. imagine? But somehow, XXXXXXX gets her belt back and re-energizes it with "star sprinkles" and kicks the bad girls' butt with the help of Cris and his prism bracelet, and they also save the whole universe in the process.<br /><br />So good triumphs over evil, niceness triumphs over rudeness, and XXXXXXX Brite and the Color Kids are once again safe to spread color and joy for all mankind.
