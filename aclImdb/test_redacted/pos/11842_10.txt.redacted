I hope XXXXXX XXXXXXX continues to make more films like this. XXXXXXXXX's books are wonderful, and as a young child raised in the Southwest his stories hit home! XXXX Beach is a highly under rated and under used actor. Wake up XXXXXXXXX, not everyone thinks that your Mel XXXXXX's are cool! Many movie goer's today want to see films that make you think. I have seen all of the Redford/XXXXXXXXX series. They are thoughtful, scenic and have great plots. I'm hoping that if enough people write to XXXXXX XXXXXXX he may decide to make a few more! Thank you XXXX Beach and Tony XXXXXXXXX for great entertainment! If anyone get's a chance to read Tony XXXXXXXXX's latest book do so! It's great. I also recommend traveling through Arizona, New Mexico, XXXX and Colorado. Stop at every view site and feel the setting of XXXXXXXXX's books. Amazing experience.
