(Contains spoilers)<br /><br />Russia in the 13th century. The opening shot shows the relics of the last invasion: moldering uniforms, human skulls and a horse's skeleton. Prince XXXXXXXXX XXXXXX (XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX) chased the swedish army away and impressed the mongol ruler to such a degree that he proposes to promote him to the rank of captain. But XXXXXX replies: "Die in your homeland but don't leave it". He intents to fish, build ships and trade. But he warns of a more dangerous enemy: XXXXXX, meaner and no possibility to buy oneself out: Germany. Their objective is XXXXXXXX. They have already reached XXXXX: Mothers and daughters suffer for their fathers and sons. The marauding occupation forces distribute the looty. Rich merchants want to purchase their liberty (always a place for some anti-capitalist p. r.), but the "common people" are ready to fight. They want XXXXXXXXX as their leader. XXXXX is burned to the ground. The teutonic knights feel invincible and have just a smug smile for the russian women who witness helplessly how their fathers and sons are butchered. Babies are thrown in the fire while high dignitaries of the church look on and remain idle. In XXXXXXXX: XXXX XXXXXXXXX has two admirers: rich and staid Gavrilo and tall and jolly XXXXXX. She promises to marry the most valiant. XXXXXX calls on XXXXXXXXX XXXXXX in Perejaslav. The prince decides not to wait for the attack but to strike at once. Even women put on a chain armor...The invaders want to bait the "russian bear", but XXXXXX's stratagem stands the test: XXXX XXXXXX is his war zone : His men know the territory but the germans, who are heavier, will break through the ice...<br /><br />Open your eyes and watch the most impressive battle scenes ever filmed. It's not just the multitude of extras (Who were, I think, pressed in this patriotic exercise), but XXXXXXXXXX's masterful management of such a large number of individuals: he displaces divisions like pieces on a chess board and nearly every shot resembles the composition of a painting by XXXXXXXXX or Rubens (Including horses in phantastic outfits). Russia in winter looks intimidating in itself, but XXXXXXXXXX's visual imagination is hors concours. Heaps of corpses are plunged in cosmic light under an endless horizon. At nightfall, XXXX and other women search with torches for survivors. A devoted falcon sits on his master's dead body while a crow waits for the right moment to pick out the eyes of the deceased. XXXXXXXXXX's direction and XXXXXXXXX's score make ALEXANDER NEVSKY the "XXXXX XXXXX" among propaganda films. XXXXXX is, of course XXXXXX's alter ego, and the russians are tall, good-looking, heroic, and they have a perfect hairdo. The germans are bearded savages and look like members of the Ku-Klux-Klan. The actor who plays XXXXXX gives a one-man-four-characters performance: first wavering, then heroic, youthful lover and comic relief. Cherkasov's main duty is to look heroic. At the end, XXXXXX-XXXXXX displays his generosity: He pardons the "little soldiers" and barters the knights for soap. Only a bearded killer and a traitorous cleric are turned over to the mob. He does not forget a final warning: Who comes with the sword will die by the sword...He kept his promise. 10/10
