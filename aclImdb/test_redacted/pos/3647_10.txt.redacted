In Tweety's S.O.S, XXXXXXXXX goes from picking garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that happens to carry a certain canary bird-and Granny, his owner. Uh-Oh! Once again, XXXXXX and Granny provide many obstacles to the cat's attempts to get the bird. XXXXXXXXX also gets seasick quite a few times, too. And the second time the red-nosed feline goes to the place on the ship that has something that cures his ailments, XXXXXX replaces it with nitroglycerin. So now Sylvester can blow fire! I'll stop here and say this is another excellent cartoon directed by XXXX Freling starring the popular cat-and-bird duo. Tweety's S.O.S is most highly recommended.
