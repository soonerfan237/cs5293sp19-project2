I bought this movie because of XXXXXX XXXXX. She was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of XXXXX (XXXX XXXXXX) girl friend. XXXXX a robber down on his luck trying to make one more heist. XXXXX goes to a funeral where he meets XXXXXXXX XX XXXX and takes him for a ride. When things don't work out on the ride they put there mines together to figure out the fastest way to get money. XXXXX and his gang decide with the help of XXXXXXXX XX XXXX to from there on mob. Rest a sure that no matter what the gang goes after that the outcome is never the same and will keep you on the edge of your sit. The rest of the out come you need to watch for yourself. As far as XXXXXX goes if you're a fan of here then you need to watch this movie because she never looked better standing on the beach with a ****** on. I give this movie 10 weasel stars on XXXXXX XXXXX body alone. It's no wonder why she was the hottest actress back in the sixties. She was the sex symbol everyone one wanted and no one could get. Not only does she look good, she can act even better. If you like, XXXXXX XXXXX then you'll like this movie
