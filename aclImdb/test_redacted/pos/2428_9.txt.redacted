I wouldn't be so sure to accept the DNA tests as irrefutable evidence against XXXX XXXXXXXX. First, read XXXXX XXXXX's book on which this film is based. XXXX XXXXXXXX knew things that only the real Grand Duchess Anastasia could possibly have known (forensic evidence in XXXX's favor aside). Second, compare the pictures of Anastasia and XXXX XXXXXXXX. Anyone can see that they are one-and-the-same person. Third, visit XXXXX XXXXX's website (url below) where you can read detailed information about the DNA tests, as well as why XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXX XXXXXXXX are not the same person (scroll down to the link, "ANNA-ANASTASIA NOTES ON FRANZISKA SCHANZKOWSKA"). Even XXXXXXXXXXXX's relatives believed that their sister and XXXX XXXXXXXX were not the same person.<br /><br />I for one will always believe that HIH Anastasia Nicolevna Romanova and XXXX XXXXXXXX were indeed the same person; I will never be swayed to the contrary .<br /><br />www.peterkurth.com
