Nightkill stars XXXXXX Mitchum as a world-weary private eye probing the case of a missing industrialist (Mike Connors). He is hired by XXXXXX Smith, the anxious wife of the missing man. What XXXXXX fails to inform Mitchum is that she knows full well her husband's whereabouts. After all, she was the one who helped her lover XXXXX Franciscus dispose of her wealthy hubby.<br /><br />What more would expect from a rotten slasher film with Robert Mitchum? Mannix goes western, monkeys are abused, models lean against classic cars, and XXXXX is constantly upstaged by Sybil Danning until a giallo style wrap-up brings the whole sorry mess to a bitter end. This is BAD cinema. And this movie is sooooo poor. It makes it look like XXXXXXXXX mixed up with Trick Or Treats. Avoid this.<br /><br />Rated R for XXXXXXX Violence, Nudity and Sexual Situations.
