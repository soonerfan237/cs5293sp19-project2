The first ever fully synchronized sound cartoon, XXXX XXXXXX's XXXXXX XXXXX makes his screen debut in the exceptionally entertaining cartoon short subject "XXXXXXXXX XXXXXX". Mickey is a worker on a steamboat under the supervision of captain XXX XXX XXXX(or XXXX as he would later be called). Mickey boards his long time companion XXXXXX XXXXX aboard the train as they frolic about, while Mickey attempts to impress XXXXXX. This short was wildly fun and positively entertaining.
