This movie was a very good Universal Monster movie. It once again stars XXX XXXXXX as The Wolfman and XXXXX XXXXXXX as XXXXXXXXXXXX's Monster. Oh yeah, that jerk XXXX XXXXXXXXX is back again as XXXXXXX. I like every actor in this movie. I especially liked XXXXXX XXXXXXX as Dr. Edelmann. (It's spelled with 2 n's) I thought it was a good idea to have the goodhearted doctor himself doomed like XXXXXX was. One scene that I think is very good is the scene when Dr. Edelmann is in deep thought as he changes. Everything that is troubling him flashes before your eyes. The good Doctor is saying no while his evil side is saying yes. That's the only reason why I didn't want the XXXXXXX character eliminated completely from this movie. I thought XXXXXXX had no business in House of XXXXXXXXXXXX. If his character was taken out you wouldn't miss him. In this film the doctor's blood is contaminated with XXXXXXX's, giving him his Jekyll and Hyde curse. I hate XXXX XXXXXXXXX and I don't think he should have ever played XXXXXXX. I didn't mind other actors playing the XXXXXXXXXXXX Monster after the great XXXXXXX because they all did good jobs. But when they get another actor to play XXXXXXX it stops right there. XXXX XXXXXXXXX thought he was so high and mighty. They offered him the role of the XXXXXXXXXXXX Monster once and he turned it down because he thought he was too highly trained. I could just picture XXXXXXXXX if he did play The Monster arguing with the director on the set, "I don't have to take this from you, I've done XXXXXXXXXXX." XXXX XXXXXXXXX wasn't XXXXXXX and he never will be. XXXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXXXX is the one and only XXXXXXX. Thank God they got Bela to come back as XXXXXXX for XXXXXX and Costello Meet XXXXXXXXXXXX. <br /><br />Don't miss this movie. It doesn't disappoint you and you will enjoy it as you did the other. This is a very good addition to the monster movies. If you're a collector, be sure not to leave this one out.<br /><br />
