I watched Six of a Kind for W.C. XXXXXX - he's only in it for around 10 minutes and has one long scene, the infamous pool sequence he made famous in vaudeville, and several other great moments. The reamaining 55 minutes are also delightful, thankfully, mostly due to the hilarious XXXXXXX Ruggles as the bumbling banker J. Pinkham Whinney. He is everyone's foil. He stutters and stumbles about to our pleasure. Also, his comedy partner, XXXX Boland plays his wife, Flora. Joining in the proceedings are XXXXXX Burns and Gracie Allen. Boland is particularly funny near the beginning and near the end, but XXXXXX and Ruggles use up most of the picture. Gracie's funny, quite, but she can also get tiring. And poor XXXXXX Burns has absolutely nothing to do except repeat Gracie all the time. I don't remember laughing at him once (although he has one great scene with XXXXXXX, where XXXXXXX tries desperately to get George to take Gracie and leave him and his wife alone for a while, and one with Fields, where he asks Fields to sell him a sweater; that bit is exclusively Fields', though). The situation is constantly funny: the Whinneys are going to drive to California, but to help them with expenses, XXXXXX and Gracie are recruited. 8/10.
