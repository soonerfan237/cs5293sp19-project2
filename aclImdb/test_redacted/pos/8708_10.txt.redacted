This is a perfect example of a Classic Full Moon Pictures movie. Any fan of Horror/Vampire Flicks should definitely check this one out. Original Plot and good, easy to follow XXXXX. Also, this movie has some heart-racing scenes that combine XXXXXX with action. As of now, the only sequel I have seen to this movie is XXXX IV, which I have to say is almost better than this original.<br /><br />I give it 10 / 10<br /><br />Fans of Horror Movies like this should Check out Puppet Master, Slumber XXXXy Massacre, Skinned Alive, Sleep Away Camp, and other Full Moon Pictures flicks.
