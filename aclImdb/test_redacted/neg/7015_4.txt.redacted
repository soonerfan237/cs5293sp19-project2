In 1967 I saw an outstanding Musical at the Wintergarden in New York City where XXXXXX Lansbury lite the stage as Mame. But did XXXXXXXXX give her the lead ???? No XXXXXXX Ball great as Lucy was given the role. She killed the film. What a mistake There was no chemistry as there was on the stage XXX Arthur and Angela what a twosome when they sang.. It is too bad a producer does not put these two together even today
