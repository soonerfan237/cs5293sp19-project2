Fans of XXXXX Anderson's productions will recognise several actors and vehicles from UFO (which was made after Doppelgänger) - as well as sound effects from various Anderson series. XXXXX Gray's excellent music (mostly unique to this film) adds to the feeling of familiarity. For these reasons alone, I think any XXXXX Anderson fan would find Doppelgänger worth getting.<br /><br />Judged simply as a film, it has to be said that Doppelgänger is flawed. It is known that there were major problems during production, and I suspect this is why there is a time-consuming plot thread that ends abruptly and appears to have no relevance to the rest of the story. Presumably time/budget constraints prevented the relevance from emerging!<br /><br />Distractingly, the special effects range from outstandingly good - better than any 1960s film that I know of - to disappointingly bad. <br /><br />Nevertheless, even with these flaws, XXXXXXXXXXXX's main story is well told and keeps the viewer (or, at least, this viewer) engaged throughout. The ending is perhaps not what one might expect from XXXXXXXX, yet at the same time it is typical of XXXXXXXX, and it is certainly appropriate. To find out what I mean you'll have to watch it for yourself. :)
