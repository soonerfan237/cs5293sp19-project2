While many pass this off as a B movie it is, indeed, a first class comedy that is well-written and acted. Red XXXXXXX is great as Wally Benton better known to radio fans as The Fox. XXX Rutherford is perfect as Wally's fiance Carol Lambert. XXXXXX Veidt leads a very well cast gang of criminals. I read one account of this movie which states that XXXXXXXX Minelli directed this film, not unless he changed his name to S. Sylvan Simon, who directed all three of the Fox movies. This is a very entertaining film made when imagination was encouraged. So get over your black and white prejudice if you have one, sit back and enjoy a truly great comedy. This was also XXX's first starring role. Take note during the climax of the reference to XXXXX Welles' War Of the Worlds broadcast.
