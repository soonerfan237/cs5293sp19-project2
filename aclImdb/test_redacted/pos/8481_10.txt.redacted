XXXXX XXXX absolutely IS XXX XXXXXXX. His performance is simply genius. He owns the film, just as XXXXXX owned "XXXX XXXXX's Daughter" and XXXXX owned "XXXXX XXXXX of Fire." In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of XXX XXXXXXX is being acted, and not played by the man himself. XXX XXXXXXX is legendary. He is well-established as a musician and the music is deep, complex, and innovative ~ even more innovative than I realized before watching this movie. The film should make new fans of a young audience who might come into it knowing little about his music. XXX XXXXXXX' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician. I confess that I knew very little about the man's life until I saw this film. I came out of it being impressed with XXX XXXXXXX' courage, strength, and innovation as man and musician.
