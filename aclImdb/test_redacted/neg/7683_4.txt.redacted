Well, "built" XXXXX Day (as Ethel S. "Dynamite" Jackson) is mistaken for thespian Ethel Barrymore, and falls in love with dancer Ray Bolger (as S. "Sam" Winthrop Putnam). Older XXXXXXXXX Claude Dauphin (as Philippe Fouquet) also digs Doris. HonestlyÂ… What were they thinking? - This wildly inappropriate musical does feature Ms. Day prettily singing the standard "April in Paris", and others. Certainly, there nothing as good as her Columbia recordings from the time; and, nothing approaches Day's stunning and forthcoming "Secret Love". Although the material does not serve him well, it's nice to see XXX Bolger performing. Some of the musical numbers are obnoxious.<br /><br />**** April in Paris (12/24/52) XXXXX Butler ~ Doris Day, Ray Bolger, Claude Dauphin
