I am a huge XXXXXXX Temple fan. When I saw this movie, it made me appreciate what a talented child XXXXXXX actually was. XXXXXX Rose Orr made possibly the worst on-screen Shirley. Imagine an 11 year old playing XXXXXXX Temple from the age of 5. That in itself is wrong. But getting her to 'mimick' XXXXXXX's voice? And her singing is woeful. The dancing was good, I'll say that. As previous users have said, there was little dramatic scenes, nothing to make the story interesting. Not even Amelia Earhart... I would have liked to have seen more of the world wide phenomenon that XXXXXXX Temple created. There was too much focus on the Wizard of Oz, when in reality, XXXXXXX was just considered for Dorothy. The film portrays it as though it is the end of the world when she does not get the role. XXXXXXX herself said that she is glad Judy Garland got to play her. For me the star of the show was the lady who played XXXXXXXX Temple. Otherwise, stay away! For great XXXXXXX Temple films, watch Heidi, Poor Little Rich Girl and Little Miss Broadway.
