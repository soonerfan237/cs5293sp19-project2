I can't believe it! Were they crazy in filming a movie about Connecticut in southern California? For god's sake, there's XXXX Tree's everywhere. In one of the opening scenes a guy says "Welcome to Connecticut" and throws down a newspaper, the newspaper says something like "XXXXXXXXX Herald". Greenwich Connecticut doesn't have a "XXXXXX" it has a "Times" as in "Stamford Advocate AND THE GREENWICH TIMES." (Refering to the Stamford, Connecticut Newspaper). Maybe the film makers should have done a little research, I mean my god, at least get the name of the newspaper right, or film in locations that look at least remotely like Connecticut.
