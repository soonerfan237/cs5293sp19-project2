Very reliable entertainment, as XXX Vegas amuses as well as intrigues, very light hearted and very much bolstered by Josh Duhanel!! I like this television show and I think that many people watch it as a form of escapist voyeurism...Voyeurism in this case is very positive, and many females in this series are very nice to look at...This show incorporates XXX Vegas legends such as Wayne Newton as intermittent characters to authenticate the XXX Vegas genre!! There have been copious depictions of sin city, this is one of the better efforts...The producers and directors are lucky to have XXXXX Caan in the show, as he is very much a totally accomplished actor!!! By and large, I like the T.V. XXXX Las Vegas and I watch it on Fridays, I watched it on Mondays as well, but with Monday Night Football, I could see why NBC switched it to Fridays...Nonetheless, I like Las Vegas a lot!!
