This is a 100% improvement over the dross of a third movie and it's one hell of a good time. This is a XXXX Hughes movie meets The Devil's Rejects. I really enjoyed this movie and it really stands out as the savior of the series. I thought XXXXXXXX Tilly played Tiffany really well and Brad Dourif in Chucky's shoes once again really makes this movie shine. Actually they're the only good parts of the movie. I got rather bored with XXXXXXXXX Heigl and Nick Stable's scenes. It's as if they were thrown in there as a sidetrack and someone to save the day. But XXXXXX and Tiffany were great to watch and I really liked the black humor to it. I thought it made the movie stand out more. If you want one hell of a good time then be sure to check this out.<br /><br />7/10.
