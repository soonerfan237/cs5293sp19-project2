An excellent thriller of all time. XXXXX Anand excels as Director and Editor. Performances by XXX Anand, Vyjayantimala, Tanuja and Ashok Kumar prove to be an asset to the film which has its screenplay worked out to the minutest detail. XXXXXXXXXXXXXX adds to the mystery, glamour and other requirements of the story as it evolves. And to top it all, music by XXXXXX Dev Burman is unforgettable. "Yeh dil na hota bechara" by XXXXXXX Kumar, "Raat akeli hai" by Asha Bhosle, "Rula ke gaya sapna mera" by Lata, "Aasman ke niche" by Lata and Rafi and "Hothon pe aisi baat main" by Lata, again reaffirm Burman Dada's unique stature as a top notch composer with a style of his own.
