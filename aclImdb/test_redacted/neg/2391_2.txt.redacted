How better to describe it than scuzzy criminals on TV? And I don't mean in the show COPS; here, they're actually being presented as protagonists.<br /><br />I don't see any remedial value in this show unless you have a perverse penchant for human tragedies. XXXXXXX Houston is a tragic example of the fallen star; a star which Bobby Brown helped pull from the sky. XXXXX Brown is nothing but a low-life criminal. Why watch him? Why does XXXXXXX stand by him no matter how despicable he is? This couple should be locked up and it's a loathsome shame they are making money and achieving a modicum of fame from watching the septic tank which is their lives and the human waste which is their character.
