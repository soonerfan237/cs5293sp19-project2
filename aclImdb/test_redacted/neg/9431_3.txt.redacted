"Shadows and XXX" is surely one of Woody Allen's weakest films, right up there with "September" and "Hollywood Ending" (though nothing Allen has done equals the awfulness of "Anything Else").<br /><br />"Shadows and XXX" is Allen's homage to the German Expressionist style of film-making, all stark and stylized light and shadow and...you guessed it.....lots of fog. But you can tell XXXXX got caught up in the technique and the parody and forgot to make a movie that anyone would care about.<br /><br />Luckily, he made "Husbands and Wives" the same year, so things weren't a total wash for him.<br /><br />Grade: D
