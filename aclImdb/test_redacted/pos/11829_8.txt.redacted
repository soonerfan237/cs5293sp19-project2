Interesting story and sympathetic treatment of racial discrimination, XXX of the Gods is rather too long and contains some hammy acting, but on the whole remains a fascinating film.<br /><br />Story about a Chinese passing as White (XXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX) starts as Barthelmess leaves college after being insulted by a trio of brainless co-eds. He embarks on a world tour to discover himself and ends up as secretary to a British playwright (XXXXXX XXXX). In Monte Carlo he meets beautiful XXXXXX XXXXXX (Constance XXXXXXX) and they fall in love. But when she discovers he is Chinese she goes berserk in a memorable scene.<br /><br />Plagued by guilt and love, XXXXXX goes into a mental spiral and makes a few attempts to contact Barthelmess. After his father dies he takes over the business (banking?) and dons Chinese garb as a symbol of his hatred of the White race that has spurned him. After a San Francisco detective tells him the truth about his birth, Barthelmess makes the decision to honor his Chinese father and mother.<br /><br />And I agree that one reviewer here never saw this film. XXXXXX declares her love for XXX BEFORE he tells her of his recent discovery. And that makes all the difference in this film.<br /><br />Barthelmess and XXXXXXX each have a few scenes where they chew the scenery, but on the whole this is a solid and interesting drama. XXXXX XXXXXXXXX is good as the nice college pal, XXXXXX XXXX is solid as the playwright XXXXXXXX, Bess Flowers has one scene as an Oklahoma Indian, and E. Alyn Warren is the Chinese father, XXXXXXX XXXXXXX is nasty Alice. Not so good are XXXXXX XXXXXXX as XXXXXXX's father and XXXXXXX XXX XXXX as XXXXXX. Also note the gorgeous blonde to the right of Barthelmess at the roulette table. What a stunner whoever she was!
