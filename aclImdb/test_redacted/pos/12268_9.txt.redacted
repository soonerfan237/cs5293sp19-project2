This movie is one of my favorite comedies of all time. The dialog is crisp, the pace is fast. Not only is this a clever comedy, this is an interesting look at what goes on behind the scenes in the television news business.<br /><br />There are so many funny lines...a couple of my favorites:<br /><br />XXXXX XXXXXXXX: (sarcastically) It must be nice to always believe you know better, to always think you're the smartest person in the room. XXXX: (seriously) NO, it's not, it's awful!!<br /><br />XXXXX: He must be good looking XXXX: How do you know that? XXXXX: No one invites a bad looking idiot to their room!<br /><br />The performances of XXXXX XXXXXX, XXXXXX XXXXXX, and XXXXXXX XXXX were absolutely brilliant! Even years later, I remember this movie well. Often forgotten is the wonderfully funny XXXX XXXXXX! I love the scene where the newsroom personnel are racing to beat a deadline. There are so many funny scenes that it's hard to pick a favorite. I highly recommend this film.
