New York family is the last in their neighborhood to get a television set, which nearly ruins XXXXX Niven's marriage to Mitzi Gaynor. Bedroom comedy that rarely ventures into the bedroom(and nothing sexy happens there anyway). Gaynor as an actress has about as much range as an oven--she turns on, she turns off. Film's sole compensation is a supporting performance by perky XXXXX Duke, pre-"Miracle Worker", as Niven's daughter. She's delightful; "XXXXX Anniversary" is not. * from ****
