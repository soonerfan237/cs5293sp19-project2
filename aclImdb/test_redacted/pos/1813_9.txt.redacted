One of the better teen comedies to be filmed during the 80's, XXXXXX Girl has a young Nicolas Cage in a starring role. XXXXXXX Foreman is fun as the object of Cage's desire (and whatever happened to her?). Look for veteran actors XXXXXXX Camp and Frederic Forrest as Julie's hippie parents - they're quite funny!
