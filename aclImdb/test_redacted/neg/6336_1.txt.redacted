This movie has got to be one of the all-time lows of XXXXXXX J. XXX's generally respectable career. I should have known how awful this movie was when I rented it and found the movie only half viewed and not rewound by the previous renter. Never a good sign! XXX plays a grown up child star who's now an agent for other show business kids. His character is delusional in that he still believes that everyone should love him for being XXXXX. His big break comes when he meets XXXXX Vega, a talented child. Vega is abrasive and not at all likeable. In fact, the only likeable character in the whole movie is XXXXX Lauper as a Brooklyn accented receptionist for the agency. One of those movies that makes me want to stick a post-it note to the box warning others not to waste their time!
