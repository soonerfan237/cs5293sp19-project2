The Hand of Death aka Countdown in XXXX XX (1976) is a vastly underrated early work by director XXXX XXX. The film stars XXXXXX XXX (XXX Tao-liang) and features XXXXXX XXXX, XXXXX XXXX and XXXXX XXXX in significant supporting roles. Many people believe, or have been lead to believe by deceptive advertising, that this is a XXXXXX XXXX film. This is not a XXXXXX XXXX film, XXXXXX XXX is the star but XXXXXX gives one of his best (most serious) early performances.<br /><br />The Hand of Death is about a Shaolin disciple named XXXXXX (XXX) who is sent on a mission to assassinate a Shaolin traitor named XXXX XXXXXXXX (Tien) and protect a revolutionary named XXXXX XX (Woo). Along his journey XXXXXX meets up with a young woodcutter named XXX (XXXX) and a disgraced sword fighter (XXXXX XXXXX) known as "the wanderer." Both men have suffered at the hands of XXXX and want to take revenge. The three team up to defeat XXXX and his eight bodyguards and escort the revolutionary to safety.<br /><br />The martial arts action is above average under the direction of XXXXX XXXX. XXXXXX XXX uses his trademark high kicks very effectively as the "Northern eighteen styles kicks" along with some "Southern five styles boxing." XXXXX XXXX and XXXXXX XXXX provide excellent martial arts performances as well. XXXXX XXXX is not the greatest martial artist on the Jade screen but does an acceptable job. Some of the early fights are a bit slow and seem over choreographed but the final showdowns featuring XXXX, XXX and Hung are very good.<br /><br />Director XXXX XXX provides plenty of interesting character development in the film, which is refreshing. The cinematography by XXXXX XXXX XXX is very stylish, unique and beautiful for a kung fu film of this era. XXXXXX Koo's music: a combination of soft flutes and 70's "XXXXX" style orchestral pieces is kung fu cinema at its best. Hand of Death is not XXXXXX and XXXXX's usual kung fu comedy. Hand of Death is a serious, straightforward revenge driven story.<br /><br />Hand of Death aka Countdown in XXXX XX is an underrated classic in the old school kung fu genre. The film is one of the best artistically of its time and a preview of the great things to come from XXXXXX XXXX and XXXXX XXXX. Hung's great choreography is put on display here before his directorial debut and XXXX's early charisma and talent can be clearly seen.<br /><br />Hand of Death is a solid, stylish old school kung fu film and a brilliant early work of the legendary XXXX XXX.<br /><br />XXXX XX Genre Rating 7.5/10 <br /><br />Wanderer to XXX (referring to his new weapon): "The Little Eagle Wing God Lance." <br /><br />XXX: "Just a knickknack."
