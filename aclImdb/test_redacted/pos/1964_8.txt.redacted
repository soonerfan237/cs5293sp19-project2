This film is one of the best of 1986 with creepy, yet intriguing performances from XXXXXXX XXXXXX and XXXXXX XXXXXX! The Reagan years were pretty bleak for a lot of people, not just teenagers, but this flick really captured the desperation and despair. Well-directed with great script (apparently based on a true story), I don't really see any weaknesses in this. The opening shot was brilliant.<br /><br />Keanu XXXXXX was decent for a change and XXXX XXXX was right on the money. XXXXXX had three other great performances that same year (Blue Velvet, XXXXX XXXXXXXX XX, and Hoosiers). I imagine this has a cult following and I wonder how this picture would fare if it was re-released. Super stuff!
