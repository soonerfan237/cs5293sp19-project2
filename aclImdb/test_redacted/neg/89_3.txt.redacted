Artificial melodrama with a screenplay adapted by XXX Dinelli from his play "The Man" concerns a boarding-house proprietress taking in a troubled handyman who may be homicidal. Despite solid work from XXX Lupino and Robert Ryan (both trying their best), this tedious yarn isn't very inventive within its one primary set (which quickly becomes visually dull) and underpopulated cast of characters (there is however a smart pooch who senses the worst!). Hokey and humorless, with a stilted direction from XXXXX Horner (perhaps Lupino should have directed?). Where's all the suspense promised by the ads? XXXXXXX also served as a co-producer. *1/2 from ****
