A well written screenplay. A moving story showing the middle class XXXXXXX at it's best. Some great acting by XXX Wilkinson and Emily Watson. XXX Wilkinson is one of Britain's best actors. He knows how to be subtle and honest. Emily XXXXXX is an actress I was not familiar with, but to her credit she does a great job of playing the ****** wife. The director, XXXXXX Fellowes did not succumb to the typical Hollywood gimmicks to give the film some meaty storyline. It has not over dramatized it's portrayal of the English middle class. The films pace does not falter although it is not a faced paced film. A good twist in the plot, that is not predictable A lovely English country village setting. I enjoyed this film very much The locations were also very well selected. If you enjoy films about relationships this is one to watch. Better to have some tissues ready!
