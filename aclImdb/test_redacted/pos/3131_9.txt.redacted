It has been recorded that XXXX Ford made the "big, blockbuster" movies so that he could afford to make the "small" movies that he loved so well. XXXXX Master, with a young Ben Johnson, is clearly one of his best, if not the best of his small movies. The location shooting, the wagons, the intricate work with horses, and the inclusion of the plains Indian are all trade marks of Ford. As in many of his other films, XXXXXXXXXX, the great Russian director's influence is seen in this film. The supporting cast including XXXX Bond, Russell Simpson, and Jane Darwell are excellent as well as the many, minor character actors Ford used, including his brother (the one who plays the drums). While XXX Johnson went on to win a well-deserved supporting Oscar for The Last Picture Show, his co-star, Harry Carey,Jr. did not reach those heights. Although his father, XXXXX, Sr. became a western leading man in Ford's early films, XXXXX, Jr. spent most of his career in supporting roles. For fans of XXXX Ford, and for fans of western films, this one is a must.
