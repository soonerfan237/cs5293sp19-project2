The subject is World War II and XXXXXX Ryan is a rejected soldier whom Lupino hires as handyman. She is a war widow.<br /><br />The set is limited but the acting makes up for this. XXXXXX Ryan is conflicted: one moment he seems nice, then confused about where he lives. At first Lupino tries to help him. He seems troubled but nothing more dangerous. But how do we know? The suspense builds. I truly enjoy films like this, which rely on the human element for suspense. What is this man capable of?. There are some scenes with O.Z. Whitehead and XXX Pollock as an annoying grocery boy who sees something is wrong. We keep thinking she will be helped, then XXXX's personality turns again. He becomes like a Jekyll/Hyde character and eventually chases XXXXXX with a knife.<br /><br />Worth watching for these two superb actors. 9/10.
