I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites though are XXXXXXXXXX, and Tombstone. This movie though, I loved! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! I even think it beat out both movies in someway. Well, not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out XXXXXXXXX though. Both had there strong points. For instance, they both had excellent well known casts, very good plots, and very good filming. But XXXXX beat out Tombstone in four ways in my opinion. First, the characters were more unique in Posse. The music was better in Posse. The idea was original in Posse, unlike XXXXX Earp. And the biggest difference, the action sequences! Oh my gosh! XXXXX was a western with really good action sequences. I mean really good! The action was fast paced. Like modern day based shoot'em up movies. The action had big budget explosions too! The fistfights were pretty good also. XXXXX Van Pebbles was great in this movie! I suggest buying this excellent movie!
