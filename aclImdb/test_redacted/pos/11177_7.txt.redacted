Being a huge die-hard XXXXXX XXXXXX fan, I fugured this one would be terrible since XXX XXXXXXX didn't make it. XXX was I surprised! Although it's still not as good as the first two, it has the comedy that I wanted. I was a little nervous about the new graphics, new SCUMM engine, and just the fact that it was on a CD. But it all came together, and it was interesting to finally hear the voices of your favorite characters. I especially enjoyed that SWORD FIGHTING had returned. And the whole story about finding the big uncursed ring was just incredible. Go ahead and try out this two-CD adventure. And now we can rejoice, because XXXXXX XXXXXX 4:Escape from XXXXXX XXXXXX is coming out REALLY REALLY soon! This fall!
