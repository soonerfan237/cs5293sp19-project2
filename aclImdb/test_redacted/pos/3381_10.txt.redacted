After getting hooked on the mini series, "North & South," I could hardly wait for the continuation, "North & South II." Then years later, along came XXXX III, "HEAVEN & HELL - NORTH & SOUTH - BOOK III." FINALLY, the last installment came for the on-going saga of the Maine and Hazard families. I was so enraptured by this series that I taped each part off of TV and then managed to get family and friends hooked and I watched it AGAIN, each time someone new wanted to see them. My tapes are old and I crave this trilogy on DVD. If you missed XXXX III, you didn't get full satisfaction and you don't know how it all turned out. Do yourself a favor and demand this set on DVD!
