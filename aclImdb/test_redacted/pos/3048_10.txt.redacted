all i can say is that each time i see CONRACK, dir. XXXXXX Ritt, DP. XXXX Alonzo, i feel an utmost sense of inspiration and enlightment in what the power of cinema is possible in such a simple film.<br /><br />the motion picture Conrack is set in 1969. It is based on a true story. It is a story about a white man (XXX Voight) who teaches a group of young black children how incredible the world is outside of their little South Carolina island.<br /><br />The story places the job of a teacher as noble cause in changing children's lives.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.
