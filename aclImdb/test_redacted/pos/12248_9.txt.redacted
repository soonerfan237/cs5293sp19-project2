I didn't like "As Good as it Gets" very much, but I am a big fan of XXXXXXX Hurt and Holly Hunter's work, so I decided to watch this movie. And the most surprising thing for me was the superb work of XXXXXX Brooks. Here, in Spain, he's little-known, and only as a 2nd division version of XXXXX Allen in the West Coast. He played a great part, but XXXXXX and Hurt were good too, specially Hurt, in an relatively unusual role for him. XXXXXX played the role that reminds me a bit of her part in "Once Around" (Lasse Hallstrom, 1991).<br /><br />Finally, the rest of the cast is great, too. XXXXXX Prosky, one of these familiar faces of the american cinema, the ex-bond girl Lois Chiles, pretty good placed on that role, I think, the always perfect Joan Cusack in her early years; and specially the brief appereance of Jack Nicholson. Maybe he doesn't have any good scene, but it's XXXX Nicholson, anyway... The Best movie by XXXXX L.Brooks, great story (well resolved), and superb cast for one of the, surely, best movies of the 80's
