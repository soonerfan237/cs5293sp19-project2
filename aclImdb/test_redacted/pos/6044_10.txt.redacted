I went through boot camp at MCRD Parris Island in 1953 and this film is about as accurate a depiction of what boots went through in that era, even to burying that danged sand flea. Many of the "actors" in the film were active duty XXXXXXX. This film may be more entertaining to XXXXXXX than others, but I feel the film itself is very well done, and XXXX XXXX made a "good DI". XXXXXX XX!
