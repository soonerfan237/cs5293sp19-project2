Really don't care that no one on here likes this movie,, i do , and that's what this review is about. XXX XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX is great in this comedic role. that line about train a b and c is now to me an instant classic, the cg is great, yeah train looks a little fake,, but the aliens wow do they ever rock,, XXXX XXXXXXX,, where's Arnold, and XXX XXXXXXXX,, wow he's been out of the loop , guess that's what jail does to you.. a bullet train is on it's way to XXX XXXXX with the Senator for him to deliver a big speech, a meteor has just hit,, and now all of a sudden we got aliens running loose aboard the train, and our hero cop has to save the day, to make matters worse his ex-wife is on board arguing with him. i just thought this movie was so wonderful,, a must see if you like action.
