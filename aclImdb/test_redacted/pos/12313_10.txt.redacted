I believe XXXX XXXXXXX's "The Dead" is a true classic. Not only was it XXXXXXX's final film, he is quoted as saying "all I know about film making is in this film." The story, closely adapted from "Dubliners" by XXXXX XXXXX, is a great ensemble piece featuring sterling performances by Angelica XXXXXXX, XXXX's daughter, and a cast of English and Irish actors who bring the story to life. This is a film that should be part of any serious collection, not only because it is visually elegant, but because the story is timeless and very appealing. The film is not hurried, nor is it charged with action. Rather, the story unfolds from within the characters, who bring light and meaning to the dialog. The end of the film is stunning, poetic, and haunting. I recommend "The Dead" without reservation as one of the finest films ever made.
