Evocatively directed and slickly photographed psychological mystery thriller with an exceptional lead performance by a sombre XXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX, and potent support roles from XXXXXX XXXXXXXXX and XXXXX XXXXXXX. The material decides to keep it all glum, and moves from the investigation period into the back-story of the victim. The seldom, and quite sullen nature of investigation pulled me in, but when it flashback to the victim's side showing her final days weren't as compelling, and became somewhat stodgy and stock-like. While the script is strongly detailed and to a certain degree complex in stringing us along, however the final and surprising revelation should have been more bone-jarring and it's not helped out by its sloppy execution. XXXXXX XXXXX's music score has an emotional sting to its cues that simply linger, and director XXXXXX XXXXXXX's capable handling (well for most part) has a strong stylistic and tight manner, which gets the best out of moody locations and flexible cast. The young faces XXXX XXXXXXXX and XXXX XXXXXX do an incredibly good job as well.
