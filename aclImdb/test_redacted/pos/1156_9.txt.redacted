1904. The North African nation of Morocco is hanging onto a tenuous Independence, as the various European powers - France, Germany, Britain, Russia, Spain, and now the United States - are vying for influence in the region. The Sultan (XXXX XXXXX) is a weak puppet; his uncle, the Bashaw (XXXXXX XXXXXXX), who is being manipulated by the French and Germans, is the real power behind the throne. XXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXX (Sean Connery), the leader of the Rif tribe and "the last of the Barbary Pirates", who kidnaps an American missionary, XXXX XXXXXXXXX (Candice XXXXXX) and her two children and takes them hostage. Back in the US, President Theodore XXXXXXXXX (XXXXX XXXXX) threatens to go to war over the issue: "XXXXXXXXX XXXXX or XXXXXXX Dead!" - seeing the issue as the perfect way to exercise his "Big Stick" diplomacy, though Secretary of State XXXX XXX (XXXX XXXXXX) is not so confident. However, the XXXXXXX has less sinister plans for the XXXXXXXXXes, who are more than capable of handling themselves in any event.<br /><br />XXXX XXXXXX's great historical film, based VERY loosely off of a true story (i.e. XXXXXXXXX was a middle-aged man), is a wonderful bit of escapism. It has some amazing action scenes, a witty, well-written script, a fine cast enjoying themselves with the material, and does not overstay its welcome like, say, "Pirates of the Caribbean" or the "Lord of the Rings" movies. It's not really an "epic" film in the strictest sense, but it's one of the best pure action movies ever made.<br /><br />While the historical context is shaky, the storyline is interesting, and as some reviewers point out, it is even more pertinent today than it was when made. As President XXXXXXXXX says, "America is like a grizzly bear" - fierce, strong, but a little blind and reckless at times. At the time of the film's setting, America has just been propelled onto the world stage as superpower, following their resounding victory in the Spanish-American War - and XXXXXXXXX seizes this incident as a way to prove America's worth. In real life, it didn't quite work out that way, but allegorically it works well. While written from a right-wing perspective, XXXXXX's screenplay is pretty accurate in assessing America and its place in the world. He admires XXXXXXXXX and his method of "big stick" diplomacy, and correctly recognizes (in the words of XXXXXXXXX) that while America may be feared and respected, they'll never be truly "loved" by the world, no matter what they do. And there are some scenes - like XXXXXXXXX's target shooting of European leaders and the almost-comic surprise attack by XXXXXXX on the Bashaw's palace - which show America's reckless and violent side, while others - the climactic showdown with the Germans - show their heroism.<br /><br />The historical/political context of the film is, of course, merely meat on the bones of what is essentially a rousing action/adventure film. There are some brilliantly done action scenes, such as XXXXXXX's rescue of the XXXXXXXXX's from double-crossing tribesmen, which features some of the best swordplay in any film. The opening entrance of the XXXXXXX and the aforementioned march and attack of the US XXXXXXX are brilliantly done bravura set pieces. And the final battle, which combines elements of "Lawrence of XXXXXX" and "The Wild Bunch", while a major historical fantasy (a three-way battle between Germans, Americans, and the Rifs), is a superbly staged, adrenaline-pumping sequence.<br /><br />The excellent cast gives some wonderful performances. Everyone seems to be having a fun time with the film, and it shows. Sean Connery is surprisingly convincing as a Berber with a Scottish accent, but manages to pull off his interesting, well-drawn and chivalrous character who comes to respect his hostage and abhors modern, uncivil warfare. Candice XXXXXX, an actress whom I've never been fond of, gives a fine performance as the feisty XXXX XXXXXXXXX, who is every bit as tough as her captor. XXXXX XXXXX is an amazingly convincing TR - you really feel he must have been like this, an athletic, blustering, yet practical and intelligent man with an admirable sense of self. The scenes of XXXXXXXXX boxing and target-shooting while discussing foreign policy are some of the greatest "bad ass" moments in movie history - and who can forget lines like "Why spoil the beauty of the thing with legality?" XXXX XXXXXX provides solid support as the weary, cautious Hay, acting as a perfect foil to the much more impetuous XXXXXXXXX. <br /><br />Among the fine supporting cast, the best are XXXXXXXX XXXXX as XXXXXX XXXXXXX, the cynical Ambassador caught in the middle of the political intrigue, and XXXXX XXXXXX, as the gung-ho XXXXXX XXXXXXX who cheerfully advocates (and carries out) "Military intervention!" as the blunt and simple solution to the whole complex situation. Other familiar faces such as XXXXXX XXXXXXX, XXXXX XXXXXXX, XXX XXXXXX, XXXXX XXXXX, XXXX XXXXX, and XXXXXXX XXXXX also do fine work, no matter how small their role. XXXXXXXXX Western fans will recognize XXXXXXX Saint-XXXX ("A Fistful of Dynamite") as the German general and XXXX XXXXXXXX as one of XXXXXXX's tribesmen.<br /><br />"The Wind and the Lion" is, all around, a wonderfully done adventure film. It has something for everyone: wonderful gun- and swordplay, a lot of humor, a tough, feisty heroine (and her two cute children), a nice (if unconsummated) romance, and an interesting (if fanciful) political/historical context. It's not a masterpiece, but hey, it wasn't trying to be. I give "The Wind and the Lion" a stirring nine stars and my highest recommendation.
