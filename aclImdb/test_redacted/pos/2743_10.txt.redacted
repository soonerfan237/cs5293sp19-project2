This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its XXXXXXX Award. Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon. Later episodes in the series (of which there were four in total) were not actually based on original Dr Seuss material, although all but the last continued to use his familiar rhyming style. The three sequels were: XXXXXX McBoing Boing's Symphony (1953); How Now Boing Boing (1954); XXXXXX McBoing Boing On Planet Moo (1956) - although he also appeared in a later episode of Mr Magoo.
