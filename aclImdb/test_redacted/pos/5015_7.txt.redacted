This movie was well acted and kept my interest in the main character for the entire movie. XXX Unger lived an extraordinary life. Imagine if XXX were alive today! This movie paints a picture of what XXX Unger's life might have felt like. It was interesting to see how connected was growing up. I would have liked to seen more detail on XXX's partying, his gamesmanship and his relationship to Bob XXXpak. But all in all, this movie was well done, well acted and the story touched on many facets of a life that was full of many events that were larger than life.<br /><br />This movie is worth renting.
