For fans of XXXXX XXXXXX, this is probably his best film. XXXXX XXXXX plays the perfect cynical, sarcastic yin to XXXXXX's "XXXX XXXX" yang. XXXXXX achieves strokes of comic genius in his monologues, like the "Let's say you're driving along the road with your family..." bit, the "Jo-Jo the Idiot Circus Boy with a pretty new pet, (his possible sale)" speech, or the "Glue-sniffing Guarantee fairy" brake pad sale. The sappy moments in the film contrast sharply with XXXXXX and XXXXX's shenanigans. Even after many viewings, it's still fun to see XXXXXX pour everything he had into the role. "XXXXXXX, what's HAPPENING to me?!?!"
