This movie is one of the worst remakes I have ever seen in my life! The acting is laughable and XXXXXX has not improved his piranhas any since 1978. 90% of the special effects are lifted from Piranha (1978), Up From The Depths (1979) and Humanoids From The Deep (1979). It makes XXXXXXX II: The Spawning look like it belongs on the American Film Institute List.
