How 'Thursday' managed to avoid attention remains a mystery. A potent mix of comedy and crime, this one takes chances where XXXXXXXXX plays it safe with the Hollywood formula. The risks don't always pay off: one character in one sequence comes off inappropriately silly and falls flat. In the lead role, XXXXXX Jane gives a wonderful and complex performance, and two brief appearances by Mickey Rourke hint at the high potential of this much under- and mis-used actor. Here's a director one should keep one's eye on.
