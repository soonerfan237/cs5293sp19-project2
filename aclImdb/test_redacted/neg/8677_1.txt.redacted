I doubt whoever wrote this screenplay has ever actually read Mansfield XXXX...or if they have it was not very well. None of the characters are what they should be: XXXXX is lively and conscious of her mistreatment, while Sir Thomas, who treated her very well, seems to have accidentally fallen into Aunt Norris' personality. Additionally, a first person narrative by XXXXX is highly inappropriate to both the story and her character. Fanny is not an entertaining heroine, and I would contend that she is not meant to be. Additionally, in the movie version, XXXXX flirts shamelessly with Edmund from the very beginning, when they have been raised as brother and sister! Austen's XXXXX would have shrank from flirtation of any sort, and the novel paints the XXXXX/Edmund pairing as highly uncomfortable...as it should be. Unlike some other XXXX Austen novels (P&P, Emma), Mansfield Park does not rest on the strength of its female protagonist. It is a very different sort of novel than the others; it is not meant to be a love story. I watched this movie because I have just now finished reading XXXXXXXXX Park, and I am absolutely horrified by what I see; Miss Austen is rolling in her grave.
