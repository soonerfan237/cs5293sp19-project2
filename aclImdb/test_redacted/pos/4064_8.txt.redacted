I'm not going to go into too much depth, but XXXXXXXX was a pretty funny movie. There wasn't any slapping-your-knee funny scenes (that I can remember), but it had it's moments. The cast is pretty good, XXXXXX De Niro is good as usual and Eddie Murphy pulls off a pretty funny performance. XXXX Russo was just fine in the film, no complaints there. There were two characters in the story that I liked that they didn't explain much at all. The first one was XXXX Sellars' (Eddie Murphy's) buddy at the gym played by Ken Campbell. I supposed he was just a friend of XXXX's, but I wanted to know more about him. The other character that I liked was XXXXX Preston's (Robert De Niro's) fellow cop/partner played by Nestor Serrano. I guess he was just another cop working with XXXXX Preston, but I wanted to know if he was his partner or what not. I think maybe I'm putting too much thought into a movie, I mean after all, it's a comedy...who cares about the characters? I guess I do though. I was really pleased to see this was directed by XXX Dey, who also directed Shanghai Noon. Ever since I saw that movie I was looking forward to his next work. I think he did a pretty good job with this film, and I again look forward to his next work.<br /><br />All in all, it was a good movie, but I wouldn't recommend paying full price for a ticket unless you're a die-hard XXXXXX De Niro/Eddie Murphy/Rene Russo fan. It was worth seeing in the theater, but not for full price, I'd recommend seeing it at matinee price. <br /><br />Also, here's some movie trivia for ya. The guy who played the camera man, played by XXXXX Friedlander is the guy in the music video "Everyday" by Dave Matthews band. He was also the clerk in "Meet The Parents", also starring XXXXXX De Niro. ...And on top of that he also played XXXXX Zoolander's brother in "Zoolander" (both Zoolander and Meet the Parents star Ben Stiller). Just some useless trivia for ya.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy the film. Thanks for reading,<br /><br />-Chris
