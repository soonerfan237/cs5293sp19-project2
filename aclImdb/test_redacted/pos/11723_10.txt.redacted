While he was great in Boogie Nights, I think that this was XXXX XXXXXXXX' best performance. He's also a great director and has made a tough, violent movie that doesn't hold back (a hooker's death by 12 gauge) and is an excellent detective story with some great actors (XXXXX XXXXX, XXXXXX XXXXX, etc.) and an outstanding jazz soundtrack. 10 out of 10
