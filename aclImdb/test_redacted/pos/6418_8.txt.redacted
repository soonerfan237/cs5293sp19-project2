OK ... The end of this may be something of a letdown after what has come before ... And XXXXX XXXXXX should have had his 10 second appearance cut out ... But there is no getting away from the fact that this is a really wonderful atmospheric Euro thriller ... I can't believe I have never seen this till now ... Its good to know there are films out there that are still worth tracking down ... And this really is ... Stunning visuals ... Haunting ... And builds an amazing atmosphere ... XXXXXXXX XXXXXX is perfect as our heroine ... And the scene on the beach with XXXXXXXXX XXXX is some of the most relaxed and perfect acting you could see ... XXXX XXXXXXX is spot on as a fellow visitor to the town who may or may not be who she seems ... If you miss the hay days of Euro cinema then chase this out ... There's a decent widescreen print going round ... And please get this out in a restored DVD someone ... They did it with the directors " XXXXX XXXX " ... And this is a much better film
