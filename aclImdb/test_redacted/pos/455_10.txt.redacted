I really enjoy this movie. The first time it was on XXXXXX Classic Movies. All the actors did very well but XXXXXXX steals the show again like always ( he is so sexy!).This is one of the movie that you do see XXXXXXX's emotions. Actually this movie this is the first I ever seen him laugh because he plays very strong, larger-than-life and serious roles in other movies. In this movie you see both a masculine, tough and sensitive side of XXXXXXX .XXXXXXX seems to be a "ladies'man" in this movie.That is amazing how XXXXXXX eats the glass cup and speaks in his Russian tongue it drives me crazy in love. I don't understand when both XXXXXXX and Kerr ( they both have very good chemistry) stars in a movie together and then XXXXXXX always die at the end it kind of reminds you "The King and I" in a way.
