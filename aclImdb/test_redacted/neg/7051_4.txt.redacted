This is a case of taking a fairy tale too far. The Enchanted Cottage delivers XXXXXXX McGuire as a "terrible ugly" spinster and Robert Young as a disfigured pilot. Long story short: Scarface marries XXXXXXXX, after which their love transforms them, miraculously (lighting, cosmetics and the removal of fake scars), into beautiful peoplea magical change that they attribute to the enchantment of living in a seaside cottage that has been the abode of generations of honeymooners.<br /><br />If the story stopped there, fine; it would be a fable with a proverbial message: beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But it lurches ahead, reaching for reality. When XXX and Mrs. Scarface greet their public, it comes as a painful shock to them that they're still homely. You see, they only appear beautiful to each other a situation which the audience is well prepared for because all the secondary characters have been sermonizing that ill-favored people really need to lower their expectations, and find other ways to be happy. You know. Take up hobbies. XXXXXXXX does woodcuts, for instance. Scarface considers collecting driftwood.<br /><br />The original playwright (XXXXXX Wing Pinero) and the filmmakers have zero faith in human nature. Their message is: You're either ugly or pretty, and no pretty person would ever love an ugly one. What's even worse, ugly people evidently need to imagine their lover as pretty. Reality just won't do.<br /><br />One wonders what XXXXXX Mason saw every day when she looked at her husband, Stephen Hawking.
