This a wonderful sequel to the award winning XXXXXXXX XXXX miniseries in the 1980's. This sequel is perhaps, better than the original. It is definitely more family friendly. The language is more subdued. There is plenty of violence and one particular scene with XXXXXXXX XXXX is particularly gruesome. However, overall a great movie. The acting is superb. XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX is fantastic. Such a great dramatic actor with a quick sense of wit and comic timing. XXX XXXXXX aptly fills Tommy Lee XXXes' shoes as XXXXXXX XXXX. XXXXX Shroder gives a great heart-filled performance as the young boy who grew up with no family to claim him. Highly recommended.
