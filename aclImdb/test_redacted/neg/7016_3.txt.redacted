Who the heck had the "bright"(?) idea of casting XXXXXXX Ball in this film??? It should have been XXXXXX Lansbury's baby all the way. At the very least XXXX should have had her singing dubbed. <br /><br />There is some compensation in the fact that XXXXX Herman's score is pretty well kept intact except for "That's How Young I Feel", and we do get performances by the original Broadway cast members Jane Connell and Bea Arthur. <br /><br />I suppose XXXXXX Preston had to be given a song, hence the inferior "Loving You". <br /><br />Overall, I think in this one the wrong redhead was cast.
