This has one of the more unusual plots I've seen in a horror film, but it's based on good, solid Universal Studios fare: Lots of monsters, pretty heroine, torch-bearing villagers. But my favorite part is XXXXX XXXXXX (The XXXX XXX) searching for the cure for his lycanthropy. After dying in the original "XXXX XXX," he is resurrected and wanders through "XXXXXXXXXXXX Meets the XXXX XXX" and "House of XXXXXXXXXXXX" searching for a way to end his affliction. I think first-time viewers will find his search in this particular movie very interesting.<br /><br />
