Much as I really like XXXXXXXXX Zeta-Jones, I wondered once again, why remake a good movie? This version lacked the tension and passion of Mostly Martha. It was a clear rip off. XXXXXX Foerste was more convincing as a hurting child who healed with love. I couldn't believe XXXXXXX Breslin. XXXXXXX Gedeck owned this role. Unfortunately Zeta-Jones should have found another one that she could own (she has other roles she does own.). XXXXXX Castellitto was good as a vulnerable but joyful Italian. XXXXX Eckhart seemed passionless in comparison. This version was pleasant but bland.<br /><br />The love between XXXXX and Martha was perhaps predictable but satisfying. The therapist added an interesting bit of color that didn't seem important. I liked it when at the end he said he'd be back but the movie was over before he returned. I have Mostly XXXXXX at home. Every now and then I revisit it.
