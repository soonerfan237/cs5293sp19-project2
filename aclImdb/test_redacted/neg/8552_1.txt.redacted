Sad... really sad. This movie has nothing (hmmm, well maybe XXXXX Danning) to keep you watching. It also hurt my eyes to see XXXXX Blair in this exploitation flick. She certainly deserves better.<br /><br />So what's the story about? Let's see... XXXXXX John Vernon tapes the inmates in rather inspiring positions, while prisoner Sybil actually runs the prison and little Linda must fight to survive... Sounds like a B-movie, huh? It is.
