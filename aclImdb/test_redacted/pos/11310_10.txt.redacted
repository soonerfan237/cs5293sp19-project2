"Medusa: Dare to be Truthful" is an outrageously funny parody that is a fine companion to the original, "XXXXXXX: Truth or Dare". XXXXX Brown's brilliant creation skewers Madonna's highly entertaining documentary (although it wasn't exactly daring, insightful, candid, or truthful) with a faithfulness to detail, right down to the packaging. I highly recommend this for Madonna fans, XXXXX Brown fans, or anyone who enjoys sharp and clever parody.
