"The Couch Trip" is one of those silly comedies that they cranked out in the '80s. In this case, XXX XXXXXXX plays a mental patient who poses as a psychiatrist, and he goes to XXXXXXX XXXXX to sub for XXXXXXX XXXXXX. Most of the movie's humor springs from their satirical look at XXXXXXX XXXXX and people's empty lives there (a woman has a power struggle with her maid).<br /><br />It's the sort of movie that you just watch to have a good time. Don't expect any kind of religious experience. But you'll most likely laugh a lot at how the XXXXXXX XXXXX people flaunt their wealth. Also starring XXXXXX XXXXXXX, XXXXX XXXXX, XXXX XXXXX and Victoria Jackson (of "UHF").
