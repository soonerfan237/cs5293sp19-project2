It's hard to decide what to say about this one. It isn't totally, one hundred percent bad. Although the movie-in-a-movie is unspeakably bad, meant to be campy, but missing by a mile. I'm pretty sure that this is intentional, however. XXXXX Aiello is perfectly adequate here, and more or less nails his pathetic character. XXXX Cannon was good in a small role. XXXXXXXX Courau was impressive as the latest twenty-something girlfriend. And XXXXX Carlson had a brave topless scene that she pulled off very well.<br /><br />So, it's not totally bad, but I don't believe that this one accomplishes its goals. All in all, it's probably worth passing on.
