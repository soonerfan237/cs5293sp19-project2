I am NOT one to like those Anime Cartoons (eg.Pokemon,Dragonball Z,Naruto), But XXXXX Bell is Different in my opinion.XXXXX Bell is more Exciting, has better characters, and doesn't focus so much on a sort of weapon or Mamodo as much as the episodes i've seen,Such as it The Episodes "Big Brother Kanchome", "XXXXX vs. Kiyo".XXXXX Bell Really focuses on the Life of The Strange XXXXX,The Smart Kiyo,The Clueless Suzy,and the WeIrD Ponygon.XXXXX Bell is probably my Fav Cartoon for now,but I encourage others to watch 1 Episode of it, you'll most likely will like it!<br /><br />-Robbie H.
