"Crossfire" is ostensibly a murder mystery but what distinguishes it from other similar movies of the period is the killer's motive, which is anti-Semitism. The story highlights examples of the kind of ignorance which fuels bigotry and contains references to a "hillbilly" and an Irish immigrant who also suffered maltreatment because of their ethnicity.<br /><br />The movie's plot is based on XXXXXXX XXXXXX' novel called "The Brick Foxhole" which is about a hate crime where the victim was gay. It's ironic that this story about a form of intolerance should be met with intolerance by the censors who stipulated that, for the screen version, the type of bigotry involved should be changed to anti-Semitism. Another irony is the behaviour of a soldier who seems fiercely proud of having served in a war against the Nazis and yet embraces their hatred of Jews. The director and producer of this movie also suffered another type of intolerance when they were blacklisted after being called to appear before the "House Un-American Activities Committee". All these points just seem to underline the deeply entrenched and intractable nature of the whole problem of bigotry as depicted in this movie.<br /><br />When Police Captain XXXXXX (XXXXXX XXXXX) investigates the murder of XXXXXX XXXXXXX (Sam Levene), he discovers that on the night when he was killed, XXXXXXX had been socialising with a group of soldiers and one of these, Corporal Arthur "XXXXX" XXXXXell (XXXXXX XXXXXX) is quickly identified as the prime suspect. Further information is also gathered from Montgomery (XXXXXX XXXX) who is another of the soldiers who was present that night and Sergeant XXXXXX (Robert XXXXXum) who's a friend of XXXXXell. XXXXXX, with the help of some other soldiers, then searches for XXXXXell and when he finds him, hears his account of what he did on the night of the murder including his meeting with a dance hall hostess called XXXXX XXXXXXXX (Gloria Grahame).<br /><br />XXXXXX helps XXXXXXX to avoid being arrested and tries to identify the murderer. XXXXX XXXXXXXX is questioned but her information is insufficient to prove XXXXXell's innocence but XXXXXX's investigations lead him to recognise the motive for the crime and subsequently, he sets up an elaborate trap which leads the real culprit into exposing his own guilt.<br /><br />"Crossfire" is a movie with a message and the identity of the murderer is revealed at a very early stage in the story. The "message" is conveyed in a way which was, no doubt, appropriate for the period in which it was made but by today's standards seems rather heavy handed. The cinematography by X XXX XXXX is just wonderful with low key lighting and creative use of numerous strategically placed table lamps combining to evoke a look which is perfectly compatible with the drama being played out on screen.<br /><br />Despite it being a low budget production, "Crossfire" was a great box office success and benefited from having an absorbing and very relevant story with a marvellous cast, two of whom were nominated for XXXXXXX XXXXXX for XXXX XXXXXXXXXX XXXXX (XXXXXX XXXX) and XXXX XXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXX (Gloria Grahame). The additional nominations for XXXXXX XXXXXXX (Best Director), producer XXXXXX XXXXX (Best Picture) and XXXX XXXXXX (Best Writing, XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX) are just further evidence of the positive recognition which this movie justifiably received.
