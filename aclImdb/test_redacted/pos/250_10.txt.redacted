"Cover Girl" is the best musical XXXX Hayworth ever made. Ms. Hayworth will always be remembered for "Gilda", however, the next movie would be "Cover Girl". The story is great. It is about a dancer who wants to be a cover girl and makes it big in show business. She does it without the help of her talented dancer/director boyfriend (Gene Kelly). XXX Kelly is given the chance to choreograph the musical numbers. The dances are spectacular. It is fun to see XXXX Silvers, a comic, do the musical numbers with Ms. Hayworth and Mr. Kelly. <br /><br />The supporting cast is perfect. XXX Bowman is given a chance to be an interesting third wheel, the other boyfriend.
