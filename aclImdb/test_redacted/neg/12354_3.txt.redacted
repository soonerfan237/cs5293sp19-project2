XXXXXXX Chaplin responds to open auditions at Lodestone Studios. XXXXX Ben Turpin arrives at the same studio, obviously another unemployed comedian! Turpin tries to horn in on XXXXXXX's action after the studio head hollers, "Next!" XXXXXXX manages to walk in over Turpin, however. XXXXXXX amusingly manages to botch jobs as an actor and carpenter. In the end, he manages to get a big break, but will a star be born? <br /><br />There are a lot of jokes involving the buttocks. The initial scene involving slapstick from XXXXXXX and Turpin is a relative highlight. Note that XXXXXX Swanson is the typist in the far background left on your screen, in the film's opening. XXXXX Ayres also appears. <br /><br />*** His New Job (2/1/15) XXXXXXX Chaplin ~ Charlie Chaplin, Ben Turpin, Charlotte Mineau
