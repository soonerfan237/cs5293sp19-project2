A brilliant Sherlock Holmes adventure starring the brilliant XXXXX Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. Despite many other actors brilliantly playing XXXXXX and Watson and making a great job of it- Rathbone and Bruce will always be the best two.<br /><br />XXXXXX takes a Professor Tobell from Switzerland to London. Tobell is wanted by the Nazi's. He has a bomb sight that could win the Second World War. His bomb-site has been split into four parts, each hidden in books. Tobell agrees to give his bomb-site to the British government. On the night of his arrival, Tobell goes to the house of his girlfriend. He has drawn some figures of men, if XXXXXX was to disappear, the lady was to give the drawings to Holmes. On his journey home he is attacked, but a Policeman stops this and the attacker runs away. XXXXXX is happy for the British government to use his bomb-site but refuses to give it to them, XXXXXX wants to look after it. The bomb-site is split into four parts, each part completely useless without the other. He gives one part each of this bomb-site to one of his scientist friends. Then XXXXXX's greatest fear happens, Tobell goes missing. Holmes visits the young lady XXXXXX was with the night he was attacked. She tells him about the drawings. The drawings have been stolen. She says only one man came in during the time XXXXXX left, to fix the light-bulb. The man she describes is Professor Moriarty. He is working for the Nazi's. Seen as he has the drawings, XXXXXX is done for. But he finds the writing pad he used and using Science, he manages to see what XXXXXX drew by looking at the next page on the pad. He sees it's code. He sees it's the name of four scientists. The first three he works out the code for, but he can't work out the fourth. The three scientists he has worked out have been murdered and the bomb-site has been taken. Holmes can't work out the fourth scientist, but neither can Moriarty. Disguised as a sailor, XXXXXX manages to get in Moriarty's office. Moriarty sees straight away it's XXXXXX, puts him in a box and has him thrown in the sea. But XXXXXX and Lestrade insist they search the box and find Holmes in it. It's now obvious Moriarty is at large. Holmes manages to work out the fourth code, a Frederick Hoffner. Holmes gets round to his house straight away and get XXXXXXX and the decisive fourth part to safety. Holmes now needs to get XXXXXXXX charged for working with the Nazi's. He pretends to be XXXXXXX. Moriarty works out the fourth code and gets two men to go round and get XXXXXXX. They take him back and he comes face to face with XXXXXXXX. Meanwhile Tobell is not in a good way, he has been tortured and tortured to get the name of the fourth scientist. Moriarty has had it with XXXXXX now, he has got him and his death must be a long one for XXXXXX. The idea is to put him in his hospital, put a needle in his vein and watch him die of blood loss, drop by drop. XXXXXX runs in and saves the day though. Moriarty gets away, but XXXXXX was only careless enough to leave Moriarty's trap door open. Moriarty plunges sixty feet.<br /><br />So, Moriarty dead. No. He makes his final outing in the film 'The Woman in Green' but in 'Green' he is definitely dead, a suicide, he jumps off his roof. It was XXXXXXXX's second of three appearances in the Rathbone series, a different actor playing him on each occasion. His first appearance in 'The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' was played by XXXXXX Zucco, his second in this film he was played by Lionell Atwill and Henry Daniels plays him in his final outing in 'The Woman in Green' The first three Holmes films made by Universal were set in the war as Holmes triumphs over the Nazi's. 'The Voice of XXXXXX' was the first, then this film and then 'Sherlock Holmes In Washington' Then it was back to Victorianish times, with definite relations to Edwardian and Georgian (George the fifth and sixth) times. This film had a close link to the Sherlock Holmes short story 'The Dancing XXX' which can be found in 'The Return of Sherlock Holmes' A great film, though obvious propaganda, it was a brilliant Holmes outing.
