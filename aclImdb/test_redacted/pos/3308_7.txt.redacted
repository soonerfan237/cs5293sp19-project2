A hugely enjoyable screen version of XXXX XXXXX's best-selling pot-boiler about the trials and tribulations, (and, naturally, the loves), of a group of women involved in one way or another in the New York publishing business. Directed by XXXX XXXXXXXXX, fairly fresh from the success of "Three Coins in a Fountain", and the prototype for the likes of "Sex and the City", except that here the sex all takes place off-screen.<br /><br />The bright young female talents of the day, (Hope Lange, XXXXX XXXXX, XXXX XXXXXX, XXXXXX XXXX), are all nicely cast while XXXX XXXXXXXX pops up as a Queen Bitch of an editor who could probably eat XXXXX XXXXXX's Miranda Priestly and spit her out; with absolutely no effort at all she steals the movie. The men include XXXXXXX XXXX, XXXXX XXXXXXX, (if it wasn't XXXXXXX XXXXXX it had to be XXXXX XXXXXXX), XXXXXX XXXXX, (before he decided, wisely, to go behind the camera) and XXXXX XXXXXX. There are more suds on display than you will find in your average launderette but if, like me, you enjoy "Desperate Housewives", not to mention XXXXXX XXXXXXXX and company then you will probably love this. A very guilty pleasure.
