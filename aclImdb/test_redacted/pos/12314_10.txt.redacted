Not often it happens that a great director´s last movie becomes such a moving, brillantly performed and filmed masterpiece. The cast is excellent as well as the camerawork. What starts up as a merry coming-together of a group of well-educated citizens of an early-20th-century- XXXXXX turns into a dark, philosophic narration about all our fear from death and the sometimes dark shadows of the past. Thank You, XXXXXX Huston, for this last piece of great cinema!
