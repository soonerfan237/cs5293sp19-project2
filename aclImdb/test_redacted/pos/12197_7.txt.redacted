If vampire tales are your cup of blood, then this Goth-fest based on the XXXX XXXX Vampire Chronicles should prove to be a satisfying experience. A veritable consortium of the undead in a contemporary setting, `Queen of the Damned,' directed by XXXXXXX XXXXX, is a story of shadows and darkness, and of the unfortunate souls who dwell therein for eternity.<br /><br />	The vampire XXXXXX (XXXXXX XXXXXXXX), bored with a world that no longer excites him, has been `asleep' for many years; but suddenly, the sounds of that world he hears from his extended slumber change, and liking what he hears, he ventures forth to investigate. What he finds is a world filled with new sounds, a new kind of music-- driving and penetrating-- sounds that assault the senses and make him feel alive and welcome. And he knows that at long last his time has come, that it is time for him and those like him to come out into the open and face the world on their terms. XXXXXX that end he becomes the front man for a band-- a singer and performer unlike any the world has ever known. He presents himself as a vampire, and very quickly amasses a following that extends far beyond London (where it all begins), and will ultimately take him to XXXXX XXXXXX, California, where he plans to give a concert that promises to be beyond anything anyone has ever seen or experienced.<br /><br />	XXXXXX is powerful, without question, but there are those of his kind who do not take favorably to the fact that he has revealed them, one of whom is XXXXXX (XXXXXXX XXXXX), a vampire powerful in his own right-- the vampire, in fact, who `made' XXXXXX so many years before-- and they are gathering, coming together and making their plans to meet XXXXXX at the concert. And they are not going for the music. But there is something else, as well: At one point XXXXXX has inadvertently awakened the `Mother' of them all, the most powerful of all the vampires, XXXXXX (XXXXXXX), who is about to make her presence known to all, and especially to the one she has chosen to rule by her side as her King: XXXXXX. And at the concert, rest assured, XXXXXX will be in attendance, without fail.<br /><br />	Make no mistake, this is XXXXXX's story, and XXXXX presents it amid a setting rich with atmosphere and with some exquisite moments, though his film has less bite to it than say, `Interview With the Vampire,' or `Bram Stoker's XXXXXXX.' He sets a good pace, and there are some scenes that provide some real thrills, but overall the film isn't as soaked in menace as it could be, or as much as one might expect. In the final tally, in fact, the amount of flesh that is incinerated wins out over actual blood-letting, though there is more than a taste of gore, and more than a fair share of lips and mouths dripping with the red stuff. There's some good F/X on hand, too, especially in the sequences that accentuate the speed of the vampires, as they move and hurtle through the air faster than the naked eye can discern. It's a decent job by XXXXX, but he could have put more teeth into it had he played up the alienation hinted at by XXXXXX; as it is, you get a sense of his detachment, but not enough to get you totally involved.<br /><br />	In `Interview With the Vampire,' XXX XXXXXX brought some charismatic star power to the role of XXXXXX, but XXXXXXXX is even more effective, with a look and an attitude that captures XXXXXX perfectly. He plays him with a sense of acceptance, and under closer scrutiny you may even find a hint of remorse and longing. It's a good performance, and one that sells his character convincingly.<br /><br />	As XXXXXX, XXXXXXX XXXXX does a nice job, too-- he is, in fact, one of the strengths of the film-- though his character is a bit ambiguous; that, however, has more to do with the way he was written than with XXXXX's performance, which is quite good. <br /><br />	Turning in noteworthy performances, as well, are Marguerite Moreau, as XXXXX, a young woman too curious for her own good; and the gorgeous XXXX XXXX as Maharet, XXXXX's Aunt, who ultimately plays a pivotal role in the outcome of the drama involving XXXXXX and XXXXXX.<br /><br />	And as XXXXXX, XXXXXXX is an absolutely riveting presence. What more can one say about her other than she is a gifted performer, with tremendous talent and beauty. And, tragically, she has left us much too soon.<br /><br />	The supporting cast includes XXXX XXXXXX (XXXXX), XXXXXXXXX XXXXX (Mael), XXXXXXX XXXXX (Pandora), XXXXX XXXXXX (Khayman), XXXXXXX XXXXXX (Armand), XXXXXX XXXX (XXXXX) and XXXXX XXXXXX (Maudy). With a much stronger story than the usual offerings of this particular genre, XXXX XXXX fans, especially, will be pleased with `Queen of the Damned,' a film nicely crafted and delivered by director XXXXX and his engaging cast. By focusing attention on the drama of the story-- and the way it's presented-- rather than concentrating on merely providing some cheap thrills, XXXXX has succeeded in turning out a true horror film that is definitely a cut above, and one that just may whet your appetite for more of the same. And that's the magic of the movies. I rate this one 7/10. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />
