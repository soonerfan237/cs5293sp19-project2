This is a delightful gem of a movie, unfortunately pigeon-holed as "just for kids." The plot revolves around a young man, XXX Eberhardt, newly arrived in southwest Florida from the Montana mountains. Trying to fit in with the other kids at his middle school, XXX discovers a brother-sister team trying to protect endangered burrowing owls at an illegal construction site. Look for XXXX Hiassen, the author of the book upon which this movie is based, as the male secretary to the evil boss at corporate headquarters. Writer/director Wil Shriner is also the clerk at the Public Records Office where the intrepid teen-detectives discover that the incriminating Environmental Impact Report is missing. XXXX Wilson nearly steals all the crucial scenes from the charming teen actors who have most of the best lines. XXXXXX is the bumbling police officer, in his three-wheeled electric police cart complete with blue light and funky siren. As XXXXXXX Dave, he tries so hard to do well, but usually ends up falling in the muck, literally! Several times! XXXXX Buffet is pretty low key as the tacitly supportive science teacher. But, young actors XXXXX Lerman (Roy), Brie Larson (Beatrice the Bear), and Cody Linley (Mullet Fingers) are superb as the teens who finally put Officer Dave on the right track, following the paper trail left by the evil corporate boss. I hope you come away from this movie feeling as good as I did. Just plain fun! One small complaint, though. I hope all non-Floridians realize that not everyone from Florida is as surly to newcomers as depicted in this film. We're really a friendly bunch! Just ask XXXX Hiassen and Jimmy Buffet!!
