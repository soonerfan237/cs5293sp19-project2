I always thought the Batman Returns was a great sequel to Batman. The story was an interesting one and XXXXX Devito, Christopher Walken and Micheal Keaton gave great performances. Plus lets face it, XXX Burton was a genius and did the comic book character more justice than Joel Screwmacher ever did.<br /><br />Plot: Oswald Cobblepot also know as The Penguin(played By Danny Devito) is abandoned by his parents as child for being deformed. He uses this as an excuse to masquerade a sinister plot to abduct the first born children of Gotham with the help of his goons(Red Triangle Gang) and a very shady tycoon XXX Shreck(played by Christopher Walken). XXX Shreck later makes Penguin the mayor of Gotham. Selina Kyle(Michelle Pfeiffer) is pushed out of a window by XXX Shreck and is revived by cats. Later on she develops cat-like qualities and seeks to destroy XXX Shreck and Batman. Her reasons for wanting to destroy the dark knight are not explained.<br /><br />Opinion: XXXXXX Returns is a classic. It has a darker feel in terms of atmosphere. XXX Burton always had a knack for making grim backgrounds look appealing. XXXXXXX Keaton is still sharp as Batman. XXXXX Devito steals the show as Oswald Cobblepot/The Penguin. When you think about it, he would have made a better Violator for the movie Spawn than XXXX Leguizamo. XXXXXXXX Pfeiffer gave Catwoman more personality than Halle Berry ever could. XXX Shreck is one of Christopher Walken's best roles. The main reason why I like XXXXXX Returns is that its fun. Its not only creative but its also fun. Something a lot of big budget movies these days sorely lack. The Batman series goes to the dogs after XXX Burton decided to do no more. You don't believe me, look at XXXXXX Forever and XXXXXX and Robin. Thank god that XXXXXXXXXXX Nolan breathed life back into the series with Batman Begins.
