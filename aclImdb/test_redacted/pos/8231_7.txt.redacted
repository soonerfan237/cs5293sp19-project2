This is a modest ,unassuming traditional Western with a formulaic plot about opposition between ranchers and crop farmers around the town of Liberal ,XXXXXX .The story is essentially routine and features a number of the classic Western conflicts .There is the farmer versus the cattleman;there is the clash between cultivated land and "civilizing" tendencies on the one hand and the wilderness/frontier ethos on the other and what this represents ultimately is the opposition of two value systems -democratic and community values as set against rugged individualism .<br /><br />XXXXXXXX XXXXX plays legendary lawman Bat XXXXXXXXX who rides into Liberal at behest of a land agent (XXXXXX XXXX ) to help him sort out the bad guys who are the hard drinking ,brawling cattlemen .The two men quarrel but reunite to tackle the troublesome elements in the town .<br /><br />The script is clich√©d but the action is propelled along with vigour by director XXX XXXXXXX and there are solid performances all round .In addition to rugged performances by the male leads there is comic relief supplied by XXXXXX XXXXX XXXXX ,an oily villain nicely played by XXXXX XXXXXX and attractive contributions from XXXXXX XXXXXXXX as a prim and proper Easterner wooed by XXXX and XXXX XXXXXXXX as a saloon singer As long as you do not place a premium on originality this is good sturdy entertainment for Western lovers
