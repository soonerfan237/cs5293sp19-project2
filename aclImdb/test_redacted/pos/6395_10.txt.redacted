It's one of my favorites TV series. A wonderful cast, great screenplay and a out siding plot.<br /><br />Watching the routine of the Kyle family is grantee of great moments of humor and great comedy performers. Let's see: - Damon Wayans: no commentaries. He's one of the bests today. Se has a perfect timing and always get the point of the joke.<br /><br />- XXXXX XXXXXXXX: Her's paranoid and sentimental XXX is just wonderful to see.<br /><br />- XXXXXX XX XXXX II: perfect for the paper. It's impossible to imagine someone else as the adorable (and dumb) XXXXXX.<br /><br />- XXXXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXXX: the egocentric XXXXXX found the perfect actress. Beautiful & talented.<br /><br />- XXXXXX XXXXXXX XXXXX: impossible to not fall in love for her.<br /><br />- Noah Grey-Cabey: this boy have future, i'm sure of it.<br /><br />I get very sad when it ends, but this show will be in my mind forever. Michael, XXX, XXXXXX, XXXXXX, XXXXX... we love you!
