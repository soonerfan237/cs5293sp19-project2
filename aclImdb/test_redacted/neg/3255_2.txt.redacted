This movie sucks. It's horrible. If anyone liked it, those people should get there heads examined. XXXXXX Mason's character sounds like a retard. That guy who tries to kill the gopher is a loser and he sucked. Even though XXXXX Chase was in this movie, he wasn't funny. This movie had crude and unfunny jokes and did not have XXXXXX Dangerfield, Ted Knight, and Bill Murray. Even though XXXXXX Mason's character had the personality of Rodney Dangerfield's character, Mason's character sucks. XXXXXX Dangerfield was funny! He should have returned! I don't care about XXX Knight, but Bill Murray should have returned, also. The original Caddyshack was XXXXXX's career performance. If he was funny in the first, he could have been funny in the second.<br /><br />Final comment: I recommend this movie to... NO ONE!!!!!!!! THIS MOVIE SUCKED!!!! IT HAS SUCKED, IT SUCKS NOW, AND IT WILL ALWAYS SUCK!!!!!!!<br /><br />2/10
