Everything you do in this world should make at least a little bit of sense. Unfortunately very little of "Delusion" makes any sense. XXXXXXXX Rubin is adequate in her role as the main squeeze of hit man Kyle Secor. Secor on the other hand overacts to the point of annoyance. XXX Metzler, the embezzling yuppie is very unbelievable as the novice, revenge seeking, adversary. When XXXXXXXX Rubin gives back the money she has carefully been concealing, all credibility flies out the window, and the guns pointing final showdown between Secor and Metzler is beyond ridiculous. Avoid "Delusion", unless you are delusional enough to believe the misguided positive reviews here. - MERK
