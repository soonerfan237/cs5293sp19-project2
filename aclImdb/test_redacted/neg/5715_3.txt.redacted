It's nice to see XXXXX Andrews trying a straight dramatic role here--something she hadn't done in awhile--but her character of Judith(wise they didn't try to pass her off as a 'Judy')has the old refined manners and tomboyish hairstyle of yore, and Andrews enacts 'grown-up' as any other actress would interpret frigid. It's a surprisingly bland drama set in Barbados involving XXXX Sharif(not the liveliest leading man around--not even in 1974!)hoping to make Andrews a spy while also slowly leading her into the proverbial bedroom. Unmemorable outing does have some camp value: the XXXXX Bond-like credits at the beginning are a cheesy hoot. As for XXXXX: she's quiet and contemplative, but that doesn't do much for the audience, or for the film. XXXXX Edwards paces the freakin' thing like a funeral. * from ****
