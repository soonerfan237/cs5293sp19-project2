This film, based on the book by XXXXXX XXXXX' -La Dentelliere- is an acclaimed film of excellent cinematography and costly Italian language. Set in a "scholastic" 19th Century, Balzac-style set, it portraits the story of a mad love story: a man and a woman. There is an infamous line at this shadowy-XXXXXXXXXX strike which reads: "She does not smell like tomatoes." Sage perfumery of this Italian masterpiece, XXXXX is a director of the stature of XXXXXXXXXX: his cake will jump in your strawberries and if you let this director he will cream your olives as a Superman. Remember Nietzsche? This one will scare the HELL out of YOU: don't forget to visit XXXXXXXXXX's cake next to the Colisseum in Rome, across the Via Appia. This movie will wipe your Pampers inside-out and outside-in, it will make you cry out of Romantic joy! If you liked XXXXXXX, you will wipe it good with these strawberries until the end of the roll. Enjoy!
