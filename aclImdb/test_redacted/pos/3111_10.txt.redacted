I loved this film because of the dialog and superb acting by XXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXX. However, I never knew until now, watching a XXXXX David marathon on TNT that this film is a remake of a 1943 XXXXX XXXXX classic called XXX Acquaintance. XXXXX co-stars with XXXXXX XXXXXXX who she was in a terrible feud with during the making of the movie because XXXXX had had an affair with XXXXXX's husband who directed her in a film before they made XXX Acquaintance.<br /><br />Anyway, both are worth every minute spent watching. I highly recommend this film if you like a lot of dialog and drama. It's a study in the psychology of women and their relationships with each other, in my opinion.
