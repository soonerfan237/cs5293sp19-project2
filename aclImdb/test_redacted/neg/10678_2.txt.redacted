I will not even make any more comments about this movie. Instead I will make a recommendation for all you Euro-horror fans: If you want to see an enjoyable low-budget XXXXXXX flick, check out Nattens engel (1998). It has everything XXXXX Blade Smile lacks: acting, nice locations, terrific score, and less hissing vampires...
