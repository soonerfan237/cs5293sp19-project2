I have seen this movie more than 50 times in my life, and each time I watch it the movie is just as entertaining as it was the first time! XXXXXX XXXXXX (played by XXXXX XXXXXXXX) leads a small group of 1960's-1970's era anti-war "hippies" living at large in New York City. This small group happens upon a young man, XXXXXX XXXXXXXX (played by XXXX XXXXXX) who has been drafted into the US Army for service in Vietnam. Despite their best efforts to dissuade him, XXXXXX does eventually report for basic training in the Army. Still distressed over his having left them, the hippie group steal a car and travel across the USA to visit XXXXXX "...for a couple of hours," in the words of XXXXXX XXXXXX (to an M.P. stationed at the entry gate of the Army base XXXXXX is temporarily stationed at in Nevada). The outcome is truly touching, so I won't spoil it for those who have not yet seen this fantastic movie. The musical score is equally fantastic! XXX Dacus (of the rock group Chicago), who plays the part of "Woof" - one of the hippies, is a not a key character, but the movie wouldn't have been the same without him. Beverly D'Angelo (who plays XXXXXX XXXXXXXX, an uptown girl who is befriended by the hippie group) is sensational in her role! A MUST SEE film!!
