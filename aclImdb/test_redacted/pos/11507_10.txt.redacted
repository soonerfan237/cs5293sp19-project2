This film by XXXXXXX Þór, director of Children of Nature, is powerful. It has great music by XXXXXXXX and good acting. It shows how sad insanity as a disease can be. There are many good jokes but the humor is dark. If that is not a problem then you should see this film. Note though this is not a comedy but a drama.
