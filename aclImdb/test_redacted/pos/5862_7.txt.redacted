XXXXXX XXXXXXXXX's "Murder by Numbers" starring XXXXXX XXXXXXX is solid work, though not particularly compelling. I am a big XXXXXX XXXXXXX fan, and she is effective here as forensic detective XXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX, who is not very likable and a broken person too. However, there is a sense of detachment inherent in the story structure. It's about the perfect murder executed by two spoiled sociopath teenagers, XXXXXXX (XXXX XXXXXXX) who is the cool one, and XXXXXX ( XXXXXXX XXXX) who is the sympathetic geek. Basically, XXXXXXX and XXXXXX kill a young woman, because they have nothing better to do on a school night. They are very smart and very arrogant which is normally not a bad thing, but it just doesn't work here. XXXX XXXXXX's script does a great job of detailing the investigation of a puzzling murder, and it is truly by the numbers. We have these two punk kids flaunting their superiority, and we just want them to take a fall. <br /><br />This is not a great exploration into the dark side, like XXXXXXXXX's "Reversal of Fortune" about XXXXX von Bulow. There are interesting turns in "Numbers". The movie is not so much a thriller, but rather a character study of Cassie. XXXXXX XXXXXXX balances the bravado of Cassie, her fear of letting people get in with her, and her secret past. Bullock brings courage and strength to a suffering character. Her partner and sort of love interest, Sam (played by XXX XXXXXXX), is more a plot unconcealing than a real character. Though XXXXXXX does the bewilderment thing very admirably. The other nice touch is having XXXXXXX and XXXXXX involved a strange sexual attraction. The most interesting thing about "Numbers" are XXXX and Gusling. <br /><br />There are many entertaining twists and turns throughout the movie. Everything is done very competently. I saw the movie about a week ago, and in retrospect I like it a little more than I did when I saw it. However, it is just not inspired work. XXXXXX XXXXXXX and XXXXXX XXXXXXXXX deserve a lot better, and so do we.
