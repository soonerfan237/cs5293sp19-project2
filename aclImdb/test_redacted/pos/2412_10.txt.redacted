THE NEXT KARATE KID, in my opinion, is an excellent martial arts flick. I thought that Eric (XXXXX Conrad) and Julie (Hilary Swank) looked good in their prom attire. To me, Ned (XXXXXXX Cavalieri) was a real bully. This was because he got XXXXX in trouble with Principal Wilkes (Eugene Boles). If you ask me, Colonel Dugan (XXXXXXX Ironside) was a pure a******! This was because he was a very harsh man who wouldn't tolerate mistakes. My favorite parts were the prom and the showdown between XXXXX and the Alpha Elite. In conclusion, I highly recommend this smash hit to all of you who like martial-arts flicks or are fans of XXXXXX Swank.
