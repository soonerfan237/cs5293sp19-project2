Ah, XXXXXX Returns, is it possible to have a sequel to be almost as good as the original? With XXXXXX Returns, it came pretty close! We have terrific actors and a great plot with the dark knight and two new villains, XXXXXXXX and The Penguin. We have XXXXXXX Keaton back as Batman and he's still awesome than ever. XXXXXXXX Pfieffer, the perfect choice for Catwoman and was perfectly cast into place. As much as I love and is such an incredible actress XXXXXXX Benning, she couldn't have been Catwoman, she doesn't really have the look. XXXXX DeVito, who could have imagined him as The Penguin? He was just great and terrifying! <br /><br />Batman returns with a more loving community of XXXXXX City, they are celebrating Christmas time with, Max Shrek played by a creepy Christopher Walken. The perfect villain who mistreats his lovely secretary, Selina who happens to hear too much at his office causing him to push her out the window in hopes that she dies and will never reveal the information of knowing the Penguin and the attempt to make him loved in Gotham. When she survives and is awakened by cats, she wants revenge and is ready to go at it with her cats! But there is also another active villain, The Penguin who is in search of his parents that abandoned him and now he is looking to be the new mayor of XXXXXX City! Can Batman be able to stop both super villains from creating their hanous acts and stop the mayor from destroying the city as well?<br /><br />You'll have to see! XXXXXX Returns is just as good as the original XXXXXX, despite the first one remaining the true classic, this one still takes you for a ride. And come on, I mean we've got XXXXXXXX in leather! Her classic moment of just meeting XXXXXX and The Penguin "Meow" is classic! There are memorable characters, lines, and sets! You'll have a blast! Trust me! <br /><br />9/10
