Owen (XXXXX Krumholtz) and Chloe (Denise Richards) are a youngish couple living in Manhattan. Owen is a moderately successful magazine writer while XXXXX is an aspiring actress. Happily for her, XXXXX gets big role on a sitcom and temporarily moves to Hollywood. Missing her, Owen books a flight to LaLa Land, as a surprise. When he arrives at her set trailer, however, the "house" is shaking, as XXXXX and her hunky co-star are having a little romantic tryst. The writer and the actress are through. Hurt and mad as a hatter, XXXX goes back to NYC. Sympathetic friends decide to set him up on a blind date with Nadine (XXXXX Jovovich) to get him out of his sulky funk. But, it goes badly, as the duo mix like oil and water, mostly due to each having a strong personality and XXXX's huge shoulder chip. Yet, over the next few months, astonishingly, XXXXXX and Owen become pals, who confide in each other and hang out. Can it turn into something more? Well, who the heck cares! This film is so STUPID that most folks will yank it out of the DVD player after the first ten minutes. The script is pathetic, dismal, and, oh, stupid, too. Then again, XXXXXXXXX gives a very obnoxious and offensive performance as well. Jovovich is not much better but who could look good with the lines she has to spout? XXXXXXX Baldwin, too, reaches a career low with his crude and sex-crazy role as Owen's brother. The only cast member who is any good is Richards but she must cringe when she looks back at this one. Okay, the costumes and production values are adequate. Then, too, there is ONE clever element in that, occasionally, the characters will speak their lines but cartoon bubbles will appear above their heads with the words of what they are truly thinking. That doesn't save the film from "bomb" status. Don't be stupid, dear film and romcom lovers. Do not rent, buy, or borrow this gigantic turkey. I am the stupidest person on earth, today, for watching this THING until the bitter end.
