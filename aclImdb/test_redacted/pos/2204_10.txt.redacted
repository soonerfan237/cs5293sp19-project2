Even if you're not a "theatre person," I highly recommend that you see this. Based off of a play of the same name by XXXXXXXXXXX Bond (which, in turn, had been based off of an old London legend), Sondheim did a wonderful job bringing it to the musical theatre stage. The score is just amazing-- by far XXXXXXXX's best, and probably one of the best scores written for a musical ever. The show was cast extremely well, my only complaint being of XXXXX Joscelyn's portrayal of Johanna. It;s good, mind you, and she's a very versatile actress, but she just doesn't sing "Greenfinch and XXXXXX Bird" too well. But other than that, it's all phenomenal-- XXXXXX Lansbury *made* the role of Mrs. Lovette, and she just does it so well. XXXXXX Hearn was a good replacement for Len Cariou in the title role, and Ken Jennings gives a great performance as Tobias. The ending will give you chills. Top marks for a wonderful show.
