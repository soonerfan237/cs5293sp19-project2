Lifeforce (1985) was a Cannon funded film directed by XXXX Hooper. It's a very interesting film that deals with a pair of space vampires who are accidentally brought back down to Earth during the latest space shuttle mission. XXXXX Railsback stars as the sole survivor of the tragedy. But really folks the movie is a mere showcase for the natural beauty of XXXXXXXX May. She's one smoking hot number. The director was a huge fan of XXXXXX Vampire (a.k.a. Erotikill). XXXX May recreates Lina Romay's title role The film is beautifully photographed and directed. There's plenty of gore effects to keep genres fans happy.<br /><br />I have to give this film a very high rating. XXXX Hooper was the man. He made three interesting films for Cannon during this time period (XXXXX Chainsaw Massacre II and Invaders from Mars as well). If you like science fiction/horror films, XXXX Hooper films or Mathilda May this film's just up your alley.<br /><br />Highest Recommendation!<br /><br />Did I mention Mathilda May is smoking hot?
