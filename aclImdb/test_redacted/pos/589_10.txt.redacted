I've Seen The Beginning Of The Muppet Movie, But Just The Half. Because I Only Watched It At Mrs Kelly's XXXXXX's House. The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So XXXXXXXXX. They Learn That If They Believe In The End Of The Rainbow, XXXXXX Can Make It, No Matter How Small, No Matter How Green(Which Was Included In The Trailer).<br /><br />Kermit Is My Favorite Protagonist(Which Means It Describes The Main Character) And So Are The Other Muppets. XXX Brooks Was Amazing When He Played Professor Max Krassman. The Scene Where Miss Piggy Saves Kermit By Doing XXXX Fu On Those Guys. It Was So Cool.<br /><br />The Muppet Movie Is The Best XXX Henson Film With The Most Hilarious Characters And People Will Cherish For His Successful Film.
