The acting is very well done, the music is very catchy, the script is ingenious, and the direction is fabulous.<br /><br />XXXXX XXXX, who acts brilliantly in every XXXXXXX episodes, acts particularly well in this episode.<br /><br />Also, great performances from XXXXXXX XXXXXXX, XXXX XXXXXXXXXXX, XXXX XXXXX and XXXXXX Culp.<br /><br />The ending is absolutely brilliant and I love the way XXXXXXX describes it.<br /><br />This is a XXXXXXX movie that WON'T, go amiss.
