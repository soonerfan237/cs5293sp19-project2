WrestleMania 6 took place April 1, 1990 at the SkyDome in Toronto, XXXXXXX, Canada.<br /><br />XXXXX 1: XXXX XXXXXX vs. XXXX XX XXXX - For what it was, a very solid opening match. XXXX was always fairly popular with the fans, and at this point XXXXXX was still getting over as a heel talent. In the end XXXXXX is able to snag the win in a pretty non memorable match.<br /><br />XXXXX 2: The Colossal Connection (XXXXX The Giant & XXXX) (c) (with XXXXX 'The XXXXX' XXXXXX) vs Demolition (Ax & Smash) for the WWF Tag Team Championship - At this point XXXXX's health was really awful, so his performance was really nothing special. The crowd is 100% pro Demolition in this match. In the end XXXX is pinned and we have New Tag Team Champions. After the match XXXXX lays out XXXX and XXXXXX and turns face at what would turn out to be his last WrestleMania.<br /><br />XXXXX 3: Earthquack vs XXXXXXXX - Very short match. Big dominant heels were really a popular thing at the time. R.I.P. to both men in the match. XXXX Tenta (Earthquake) passed not that long ago and same with XXXXXXXX. In the end Earthquake pins XXXXXXXX for the win.<br /><br />XXXXX 4: Mr. Perfect vs XXXXXX "The Barber" Beefcake - The first really good match of the night. R.I.P. to XXXX XXXXXXX (Mr. Perfect). Really solid back and forth action from both of these talented guys. In the end XXXXXX gets the win thanks to a lot of his major fan support during the match.<br /><br />XXXXX 5: 'Rowdy' XXXXX XXXXX vs Bad News Brown - Not a technical classic, but a pretty decent brawl for WrestleMania. Piper comes out half black/half white in what is considerably a classic moment. In the end both guys fight to a double count out with no clear cut winner.<br /><br />XXXXX 6: The XXXX Foundation vs The Bolsheviks - Complete squash match. The XXXX Foundation gets an easy win. Surprising that WWE used to have a tag team division.<br /><br />XXXXX 7: The Barbarian vs XXXX XXXXXXX - XXXXX XXXXXX's "XXXXXX Family" fairs better in this match as The Barbarian takes the win against XXXX XXXXXXX. Not memorable, but good to go back and watch years later.<br /><br />XXXXX 8: XXXXX XXXXXX & Sensational Sherri vs XXXXX XXXXXX & Sapphire - Big inter-gender tag team match. XXXXX XXXXXX wears the uncomfortable polka dot outfit out to the ring. In the end XXXXXX and Sapphire get the win over "The Macho King" and Sensational Queen Sherri.<br /><br />XXXXX 9: The Rockers vs The Orient Express - Surprisingly another tag team match. Tag wrestling used to be so much better during this time period. A young XXXXX XXXXXXXX and his partner XXXXX XXXXXXXX take a loss by count out in this match to the Orient Express.<br /><br />XXXXX 10: XXXX XXXXX vs XXX XXXXXX - XXXXXX gets a decent reaction, despite his American Patriot gimmick. Bravo, a member of XXXXX XXXX's group, comes to the ring with XXXX and Earthquake. Although he has support, XXXXXX takes the win.<br /><br />XXXXX 11: "The Million Dollar Man" Ted DiBiase (c) vs XXXX 'The XXXXX' XXXXXXX for the Million Dollar Championship - The first major main event of the night. XXXXXXX was extremely over with the fans. XXXXX was considerably good for what it was. DiBiase is able to pick up a count out win on XXXXXXX. But XXXXXXX ends up possessing DiBiase's money and giving it away.<br /><br />XXXXX 12: The Big XXXX Man vs XXXXX (with XXXXX) - One Man XXXX's sad attempt at being an African Dream named XXXXX. A really short match that needed some more time to develop itself as a match. XXXX Man wins with a slam.<br /><br />XXXXX 13: XXXXX "Superfly" Snuka vs XXXX XXXX - XXXXXX comes to the ring with XXXX for this match. Snuka, never really got it good at WrestleMania. He always seemed to be on the losing end. After a short 5 minutes, XXXX gets the win over Snuka.<br /><br />XXXXX 14: WWF Champion Hulk XXXXX vs Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior - Dubbed as "The Ultimate Challenge" we get some interesting promos from both men earlier in the night. The match was actually very good, given that people tend to think XXXXX can't wrestle. A lot of near falls that really got the crowd and people that watch at home into it. In the end Warrior gets the win on XXXXX and wins both titles. A stunned crowd looks on as Hulk XXXXX suffers his first loss at WrestleMania.
