Although copies of this movie are hard to find, if you can find it, get it!! !!! I believe this was, aside from In The Navy, XXXXXX and Costello's only musical. Although they twisted the plot around a little, (I've never heard a version where the butcher goes up with him), you still enjoy the antics of the slightly idiotic but lovable XXXX, and the greedy butcher, Mr. Dinklepuss. Slightly reminiscent of DuBarry Was a Lady, this uproarious film will have you rolling on the floor - only to get up and dance as XXX Costello sings. (I don't know why they didn't do that in other films.)
