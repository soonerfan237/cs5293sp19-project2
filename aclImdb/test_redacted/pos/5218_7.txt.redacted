(Some Spoilers) Facing a mid-life crisis and fed up with his marriage to XXXXX ,Teddi Siddall, who seemed to have more say in what he did and where he stayed then the Air Force,USAF elite Red Beret Sgt. Major XXXXX Bay, Gary Cole,decided one morning to just walk away from in all and start a new life as a civilian. <br /><br />XXXXX first got this idea when he met at a Halloween party sweet and adoring Alyson, Karen Sillas. Keeping his background secret from her by telling XXXXXX that he's in a top secret military outfit was the perfect cover for him. Back at Jackson AFB outside of XXXXXX Tex. XXXXX starts to review his life's options with Cindy and the USAF and decides to change his identity by running away from it. XXXXX then calls Alyson, who only met him once, and makes a date with her. Before you know it XXXXX, now using the name Haywood,is engaged to be married to her.<br /><br />Faking his death in a bicycle accident Dave purposely leave his wife and kids out in the cold and deserts his military obligation to his country.It didn't take long for Dave to find out that civilian life just doesn't appeal to him. It's now too late for XXXX to go back to his first wife Cindy and his two boys with him facing the brig and a military court-martial if he comes back to the USAF. XXXX takes up the only job that he could do to support him and Alyson and their infant son Chris: using his skills he learned in the Red Berets to rob banks.<br /><br />Based on a true story "Lies He Told" has XXXX Bay/Haywood living three, not two, different lives. One of a hard working family man one as a ruthless bank robber and yet another one as a dead and highly decorated, by the President of the US and Prime Misnister Of GB, All-American hero. XXXX Cole is very effective as both Master Sgt. XXXXX Bay&husband XXXXX Haywood. Davids actions are, even though unforgivable, understandable in the case of his depression over his marriage to XXXXX. The pressure of her nagging him got to the point where he just wanted to get lost and away from her and the kids. But he should have sought professional counseling from the US Air Force, which he would have been gladly provided with, instead of choosing the easy way out. Which in the end lead him straight into Levenworth Ferderal Prison. It may have been that the overly macho XXXX thought it would have been a bad mark on his career, as well as his ego, to get help for his problems.<br /><br />Karen Sillas as Alyson is the glue that keeps the film together with her at first going along with her new husbands explanation of his frequent disappearances, some for as much as two weeks, as him doing covert action in keeping the country safe from domestic and foreign terrorists. The real reasons for his long absences were the result of him casing out planing and robbing banks. XXXXX was the only way he knew how to earn a living given from what he learned, in subversive actions, all those years in the elite Red Berets.<br /><br />Alyson tracking down Dave's mom Carolyn Bay(Linda Goranson), who he told her was dead since he was a small boy, in Portland she finds out the truth about the double, or triple, life that he's been leading since he married her. This lead to XXXXXX finding out about his marriage to Linda and the two sons that he had with her as well as his faked death, and now AWOL, from the USAF. Being that it's a true story the ending was anything that you would have guessed it to be in a standard Hollywood, or made for TV, movie. That's what makes the film "Lies he Told, a lot better then what you would have expected it to be.
