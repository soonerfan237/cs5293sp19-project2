XXXX XXXiyaan is a great film. A very breezy entertainer and a very modern film for its time in the 1960s. The Music and songs are terrific though the lyrics of Majrooh are meaningless at places. XXX Anand is a tremendous star and as usual does great justice to his role. XXXXXXX is sexy and XXXXX is OK. XXXX too is just about OK. The film has terrific dialogue by XXXXXXXXX XXXX who wrote most of XXX Anand's films like XXXXX, Duniya, Warrant, XXXXX XXXX, Manzil, etc.etc.<br /><br />It is a story of XXX getting attracted to three females - the mod XXXXXXX, XXXX and the homely XXXXX. He eventually opts for XXXXX. The story is about OK but its been narrated in a gripping way and the dialogue and XXXXX and the great XXX Anand are the highlight of the film. A must watch film for all XXX Anand fans.
