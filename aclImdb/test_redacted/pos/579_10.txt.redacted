This wonderful movie captures so many elements of what makes a family comedy funny, entertaining, sweet and memorable, it's difficult to decide where to start.<br /><br />From the opening number, "XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX," XXXX XXXXXXXX's excellent score sung with gusto by XXXXXX XX XXXX, which gives us a prologue of what the whole adventure is about, throughout the story, this is one fun movie.<br /><br />Essentially, it's a road trip movie, where XXXXXX travels cross-country with a dream of pursuing a "rich and famous contract" to entertain. Along the way, our green hero meets a series of other aspiring actors, comedians, singers, and musicians, who coincidentally, are muppets like XXXXXX himself. Is this how the Muppets really started? "Approximately how it happened," XXXXXX tells us.<br /><br />Not since "It's a XXX, XXX, XXX, XXX World" has the cameo formula been used so prolifically and successfully. The aspiring stars encounter many recognizable faces during their Odyssey; some just blink across the screen, but others have very memorable cameos. XXXXX XXXXXX's amusing bit as a rude waiter is probably the best. XXXXXXXXX XXX XXXXXX's nod to his inspiration, XXXXX XXXXXX, is especially touching.<br /><br />Anyone who ever watched the Muppets TV show will get to see all of their favorite characters, they're all here. The puppetry work is magnificent; look especially for XXXXXX riding a bicycle (how dey do dat???) In-jokes and references to old movies are everywhere, but the best one-liners are reserved for XXXXXX himself. An example: when the crooks are terrorizing XXXXXX and XXXXX, she affectionately says to her short, green, and handsome beau, "I wouldn't give up this evening together for anything, would you?" "Uhhh, make me an offer...." I also love the gunfight at the OK Corral scene: brilliantly absurd silliness.<br /><br />Gotta get "XXXXX' right along" now, but to summarize: a good natured movie that can be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of age or movie genre taste. Highly recommended.
