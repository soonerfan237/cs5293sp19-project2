On assignment in scenic Italy, beautiful lip-synching XXXX Turner (as Fredda Barlo) meets older singer and prince Ezio Pinza (as Mr. Imperium). The two fall in love, while enjoying the pretty Italian countryside. Unhappily, XXX Pinza is called away to his Kingly father's death bed, leaving Lana in the lurch. Twelve years later, Ms. XXXXXX is a Los Angeles actress, about to make a motion picture about falling in love with a King. Turner is being romanced by co-star XXXXX Sullivan, who wants to marry her - then, King Pinza re-enters her lifeÂ… <br /><br />"Mr. Imperium" provides a tired storyline for sex symbol Turner and debuting bass vocalist Pinza, who appeared for several decades with the New York Metropolitan Opera. XXXXX likely earned his MGM feature film career after appearing in the hugely successful stage production of "South Pacific" (1949). The cast album, and XXXXX's golden "Some Enchanted Evening" single, sold millions. Supporting casters XXXXXXXX Main, Cedric Hardwicke, and Debbie Reynolds give the film a even greater sense of wasted resources.<br /><br />*** Mr. Imperium (1951) Don Hartman ~ Lana Turner, Ezio Pinza, Barry Sullivan
