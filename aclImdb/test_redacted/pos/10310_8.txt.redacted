I think that the movie was really good. Subject, acting and XXXXXX Fateh ALi Khan's music were marvellous. Although the director has succeeded in showing the status of women in rural areas and how they suffer at the hands of male-dominated culture, he has neglected XXXXXXX's character a bit and has focussed more on the violence faced by her.
