XXXXX is watching an actor rehearse his lines: "A ham, A ham! My kingdom for a ham sandwich!!!" The dramatic guy that tells XXXXX he'll "have to sacrifice my art and go into the movies." He's in tears. XXXXX just looks at him like he's nuts, and shrugs his shoulders. The old guy tells XXXXX to "go ye forth" and find money to finance a trip to Hollywood. XXXXX thinks, "How does he expect me to get the money?"<br /><br />In minutes, of course (this is a cartoon), he spots a shoe business owner putting up a "bankrupt" sale on his store. XXXXX comes up with a plan to bail him out and the man promises the cat $500 if it works.<br /><br />Well, it does but the man wants to go alone and leave XXXXX at home. In an outrageous scene, XXXXX transforms himself into a briefcase and that's how he gets to Hollywood, transforming himself back to cat when they get there.<br /><br />We then witness XXXXX's attempts at getting into show business. His audition scenes are very funny, especially with his imitation of XXXXXXX XXXXXXX. In addition there are caricatures of some famous silent film stars and executives. In all, quite a bit of material is in this 9.5- minute cartoon. It's amazing how much more you can get in an extra 2.5 minutes, assuming most animated shorts are seven minutes in length.<br /><br />At any rate, there were a number of laughs in here and more zany things you could only see in a cartoon, like XXXXX have a sword duel with giant mosquitoes! Crazy stuff.
