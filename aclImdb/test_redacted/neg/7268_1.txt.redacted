What the hell is this!? That was my first reaction to this film (actually, my first reaction contained more swearing). This isn't XXXX Wars! XXXX Wars is space battles, this movie has none. XXXX Wars is the Force, this movie only has a retarded witch with a magic ring. XXXX Wars is lightsaber battles, this movie hasn't got any battle worth mentioning. XXXX Wars is humor, this movie isn't. XXXX Wars is a galaxy far, far away, this movie has HORSES in it!!! Besides all of this, how did XXXXX get the insane idea to let a five year old baby do the leading role !? Big, big disappointment. Do you like XXXX Wars? Don't watch this! 1 out of 10
