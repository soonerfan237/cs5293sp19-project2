Very good "Precoder" starring XXXX XXXXXXXXXXX, which in a way, kind of reminded me of XXXXX' "Only Angels Have Wings" (1939), in which XXXXXXXXXXX also acted. This film was directed by masterful XXXXXXX XXXXXXX, who was responsible for the landmark aviation Silent picture "Wings".<br /><br />XXXXXXXXXXX plays a devil-may-care airplane pilot, who is a blamed for an aviation accident. Afterwards he meets and falls for pretty XXXXX XXXXXX, who participates as part of an Act in an itinerant XXX XXXXXX; but when XXXXXXXXXXX' brother appears in scene, a triangular relationship ensues.<br /><br />"Central Airport" has many thrilling moments and some moving and touching scenes too, thanks to the great chemistry that develops between XXXXXXXXXXX and Eilers (who, in my opinion, in this film resembles very much actress XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX). XXX XXXXX is good as XXXXXXXXXXX brother, fresh from his success in Wyler's "XXX XXXXX of Culver".<br /><br />Great special effects, good flying stunts, swiftly paced film; in all, highly entertaining. Don't miss it when TCM airs it again.
