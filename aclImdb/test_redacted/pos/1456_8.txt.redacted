The Man With a Golden Arm was one of a trio of great films around that same time that dealt with drug addiction. The other two were Monkey On My Back and A Hatful of Rain. But I think of the three this one is the best.<br /><br />Maybe if XXXX XXXXXXXXX had shot the thing in the real Chicago instead of those obvious studio sets the film might have been better yet. Who knows, maybe Preminger couldn't get enough money to pay for the location. It's the only flaw I find in the film.<br /><br />XXXXX XXXXXXX is a heroin addicted card dealer who was busted for covering for his boss XXXXXX XXXXXXX when the game was raided. He took the cure while in jail and wants a new life as a jazz drummer. But a whole lot of people are conspiring against him.<br /><br />First XXX XXXXXXX who wants him back dealing, especially because a couple of heavyweight gamblers are in town. He uses a few underhanded methods to get XXXXXXX's services back. Secondly XXXXXX XXXXXXX is the local dope dealer who wants XXXXXXX good and hooked as a customer again. And finally XXXXXXX XXXXXX his clinging wife who's working a con game to beat all, just to keep him around.<br /><br />XXXXX XXXXXXX got a nomination for XXXX XXXXX for this film, but lost to XXXXXX XXXXXXXX in XXXXX. XXXXXXX might have won for this one if he hadn't won for From Here to Eternity in the Supporting Actor category a few years back and that XXXXX was such an acclaimed film in that year. His scenes going through withdrawal locked up in XXX XXXXX's apartment will leave you shaken.<br /><br />XXXXXXX XXXXXX does not get enough credit for her role. She's really something as the crazy scheming wife who wants XXXXXXX tied to her no matter what the cost. If she had not been nominated that same year for Interrupted Melody, she might have been nominated for this. 1955 marked the high point of her career. <br /><br />XXXXXX XXXXXXX got his first real notice as the very serpentine drug peddler. His performance is guaranteed to make your flesh crawl.<br /><br />Elmer XXXXXXXXX contributed a great jazz score to accentuate the general dinginess of the bleak Chicago neighborhood the characters live in. Not a place you'd want to bring up your family.
