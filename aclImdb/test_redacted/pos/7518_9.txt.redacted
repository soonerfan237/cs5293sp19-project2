Anybody who goes to the Manhattan Hospital Center is taking his life in his hands. That includes the staff of The Hospital.<br /><br />I had never seen The Hospital before and I was intrigued at how similar the characters and situations of the plot were to that other XXXXX XXXXXXXXX masterpiece, XXXXXXX. There are elements in XXXXXX XX XXXXX's character that have both XX XXXXXXXXXX's and XXXXXX XXXXX's.<br /><br />He's the administrator of The Hospital and he's mad as hell and not going to take it any more. He's completely estranged from his wife and kids. It takes a Faye Dunaway type character in the person of XXXXX XXXX to make him snap out of it. One roll in the hay with her and he's shocked back to reality and the fact he still can contribute in the world.<br /><br />But first he's got a real problem. Someone is out killing hospital staff, four of them in a 48 hour period. And the nice part is their deaths can be attributed to in large part to the general incompetence of a medical bureaucracy. That's where the comedy comes in.<br /><br />There is an actual XXXXXX XXXXX type character in the person of XXXXXXX XXXXXX, XXXXX XXXX's father. His end is not quite as dramatic as XXXXX's though.<br /><br />Back in my working days it was part of my job to pay medical suppliers. Some of them could be as big creeps as you'll find portrayed in The Hospital. The black comedy satire had some real bite to it for me.<br /><br />XXXXXX XX XXXXX was nominated for XXXX XXXXX, but having won and refused to accept the previous year's Oscar for XXXXXX, he wasn't about to get a second chance. He lost to XXXX XXXXXXX for The French Connection. Still his handling of the role is unforgettable.<br /><br />Try viewing The Hospital back to back with XXXXXXX and see how many similarities you spot.
