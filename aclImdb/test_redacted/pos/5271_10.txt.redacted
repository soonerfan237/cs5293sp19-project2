Helges best movie by far. Very funny, very surrealistic. If XXXXXX made a movie starring Buster Keaton as Krusty the Clown it would look like this.<br /><br />Brilliant performances by the cast we already know from other Schneider movies, especially Helmut KÃ¶rschgen as the sidekick of 00Schneider. (XXXXXXX Kunze who once more plays the wife in this one is a bit annoying though). And of course Helge himself as XXXXX Baxter is absolutely incredible.<br /><br />P.S: if this movie had a proper merchandising i would really like to buy a replica of that "Holz ist" painting.
