The "Hunting Trilogy" of XXXXXX Fire (1951), XXXXXX Seasoning (1952), and Duck! Rabbit! Duck! (1953) should be considered the comedic high water mark of the XXXXX Jones-Michael Maltese collaboration. While they are seldom mentioned in lists of the "greatest" or "most important" cartoons in the history of animation, they are certainly THE FUNNIEST cartoons I've ever seen. XXXXXXX Maltese never got the credit that directors like Jones, Freleng or Avery got, but it's his dialogue and situations that make Warner Bros. cartoons, and these three in particular, some of the FUNNIEST ever made.
