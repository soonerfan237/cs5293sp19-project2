In my opinion, National Velvet is one of the top family classic's of all time. It features XXXXXX Rooney as (Mi Taylor) and Elizabeth Taylor as (Velvet Brown).<br /><br />Velvet wins a race horse, named (Pie) in a raffle. She falls in love with it right away. With the help of Mi, an ex-jockey, they train it to race in the Grand National's. After the jockey who was scheduled to race XXX backs out at the last moment, Mi convinces Velvet to take his place.<br /><br />This was a well put together motion picture. Fine storyline and top notch acting. The inner play between XXXXXXXXX and Mickey was magical. This is a wonderful family picture expertly Directed by XXXXXXXX Brown. The photography is stunning. This is a movie you will enjoy for years to come.<br /><br />This picture is what made XXXXXXXXX Taylor a household name. Both Mickey and XXXXXXXXX remained close after the film. They still send post cards to each other after all these many years. <br /><br />One side note. XXXXXXXXX loved the horse "Pie" so much that the studio gave it to her.
