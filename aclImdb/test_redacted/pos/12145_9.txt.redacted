XXXXXX Tous Risques (The Big Risk) is repeatedly recommended every time I look up a Jean-Pierre XXXXXXXX film that I had to give it a watch as soon as possible. Since I've been discovering XXXXXXXX and seemingly working backwards through his filmography, it would be easy for me to mistake this as one of his films, but it was made in 1960, by XXXXXX XXXXXX, before XXXXXXXX would come and stake his claim on french neo-noir.<br /><br />XXXXXX Tous Risques has two of the best lead men of the time, XXXX XXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX. Ventura plays XXXX, a gangster exiled in Italy with his wife and two kids, who wants to come back to Paris because the police are closing in on him. After a roaring and fast paced opening with a big surprise, XXXX eventually gets hooked up with XXXX XXXXX (Belmondo) who wants to get into the criminal underworld. XXXXX becomes XXXX's chauffeur and eventual only friend in an underworld that turns it's back on XXXX after everything he's done and been through. The film shows the the duality of the two men, the older XXXX at the end of his time after tragedy strikes him, and the younger Eric starting off the same way XXXX did, falling in love with a beautiful woman who sticks with her man despite the world they are a part of. It never ends pretty for them, or their loved ones. Its one thing to see a individual criminal come to his demise, its different when he has loved ones he risks taking down with him.<br /><br />Much like XXXXXXXX's film, the seemingly simple story gets more subtlety complicated as it goes along. As usual, as what I feel with XXXXXXXX's films, it left my head spinning (in a good way) and dying to re watch it again to pick up what I missed the first time. XXXXXX Tous Risques is a definite keeper.
