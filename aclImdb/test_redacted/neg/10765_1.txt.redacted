This is by far the most repulsive and atrocious version of The Scarlet Pimpernel ever to be devised. As a Pimpernel fan, I was sincerely offended by what they did to the characters--but this atrocity is not worth watching, even if you aren't familiar with the story.<br /><br />XXXXX Blakeney, for example, would never stab people in the back just to get down a hallway. XXXXXXXXX would never have a string of women in his bed. XXXXXXXXXX never had an affair with Chauvelin, nor Armand with Minette, whoever the heck she is. XXXXXXXXX would not randomly shoot Tony in the head. XXXXXXXXX's name is not, nor has it ever been, Paul. They have completely eradicated any reference to the Pimpernel's disguises, replacing them instead with XXXXX Bond-esque gadgets and gizmos.<br /><br />As to the film itself... The makeup is horrifying. The women look like clowns. XXXXXXXXX McGovern's beauty mark wanders around her face at random. The poor, pitiable actors have no script to work with, so it's not really their fault that their characters are as thin as wet tissue paper. The dialogue... oh, the dialogue. The dialogue is unbearable. And whoever is responsible for all those little captions at the bottom of the screen should be forced to watch this movie as penance. (I counted 13 location captions in the first half-hour before I gave up. As if we can't figure out that the body of water between England and France is the English Channel.)<br /><br />The film--if I can bring myself to call it that, since it's really just videotape with a filter--is absolutely without redeeming value. Do not waste your time and brain cells on this rancid drivel--instead, go watch the 1982 XXXXXXX Andrews/Jane Seymour version, or the 1934 Leslie Howard film, or indeed ANYTHING but this one.
