During my trip in a youth leadership forum, I was channel surfing until I found "XXXXX XXX" on TBS. Since I have never seen this film before, I wanted to check it out. My roommate, who have already seen this, told me, "This movie is a classic." After seeing the whole movie, I came to the conclusion that he was right.<br /><br />"XXXXX XXX" is constantly funny from beginning to end, thanks to the comedic duo of XXXXX XXXXXX and XXXXX XXXXX. XXXXXX is a riot as the title character, a spastic doofus who just sails through life as if it wasn't important. His slacker-esqe ways soon come to a halt when his father (XXXXX XXXXXXX), a wealthy "XXXXX XXXX King", dies of a heart attack on his wedding day. This leads XXXXX, with the help of his sarcastic childhood friend XXXXXXX (XXXXX XXXXX), to hit the road to sell enough break pads to save the company.<br /><br />The main reason "XXXXX XXX" works are the funny performances from the lead cast. XXXXXX is the funniest person in this movie, the second funniest person being XXXXX and the third being XXX XXXX as the film's villain who has bad luck. Another funny guy is XXX XXXXXXX as XXX XXXXXXXX, a well-known auto parts extraordinare.<br /><br />Another reason the movie works is the large amount of jokes. XXXXX XXXXXX has hilarious slapstick moments, and XXXXX XXXXX has funny snide comments and one-liners. The gags in the movie (some which involves a deer and a airplane bathroom) are laugh-out-loud funny, thanks to director XXXXX XXXXX (XXXXX XXX 33 1/3), writers XXXXXX & XXXXX XXXXXX<br /><br />(3rd Rock From the Sun, That 70s Show), and the cast.<br /><br />"XXXXX XXX" is a really funny movie, although for some unknown reason most film critics (including XXXXX XXXXX) find it horrible and unfunny. (I wonder when their sense of humor died.) I recommend "XXXXX XXX" for those who are great fans of comedy. Thank you very much, roommate.
