A terrific comedy-drama about the powers of friendship. Despite it's a remake of a 1939 film of the same title, it would probably be compared to XXX And The City. I would not compare to it totally. The story starts with XXXX(XXX Ryan) who seems to the life most women would envy, she's happily married, has a good daughter, great friends, and a great home. But XXXXs perfect life isn't what it seems, when she discovers her husband is cheating on her with Crystal(XXX XXXXXX) from Zach's. XXXX is puzzled and doesn't know what to do. But her four good friends, Sylvia(XXXXXXX XXXXXX), Edie(XXXXX XXXXXXX), and Alex(Jada Pickett Smith) try to be there for her in anyway they can. I really don't want to give anymore away. But I found this enjoyable, and I'm a man. XXX Ryan is great, it is nice to see her in on the screen again, after a series of flops. And the rest of the cast are also great including XXX XXXXXX as Crystal. Just an enjoyable lighthearted comedy.
