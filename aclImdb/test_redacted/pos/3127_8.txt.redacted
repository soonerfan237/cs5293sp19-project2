A couple of cowpokes help a group of Mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement. This low-key Western is unusual for XXXX in that it lacks any big stars. XXXXXXX gets top-billing but his is basically a supporting role, although he and XXXXX work well together. Dru is given little to do other than provide the love interest. The best performance is given by XXXX favorite Bond, playing the leader of the Mormons. In fact, this role helped him land a starring role in the long-running TV Western "XXXXX XXXXX" before his untimely death at age 57. Featuring beautiful cinematography, XXXX regarded this as one of his favorite films.
