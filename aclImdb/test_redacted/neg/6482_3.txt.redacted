Role-reversal remake of 1942's "The Major and the Minor" has XXXXX Lewis stepping into the part originally played by Ginger Rogers, but unfortunately this anemic outing is missing a lot more than just Ginger. XXXXX attempts to pass for a child when boarding a train; he's successful, but the deception leads to a string of comic and romantic confusions. XXXXXX Sheldon adapted the screenplay, tossing in musical moments for Dean Martin (playing yet another in his stable of second-bananas) and a jewel-robbery subplot (which is dire). XXXXX Lynn, who played the wily teenager in the original film, plays Lewis' love-interest here. She's cute; XXXXX isn't. *1/2 from ****
