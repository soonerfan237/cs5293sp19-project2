I can't say what knowing the source for this movie adds, but this is one of my favorite films from XXXX XXXXXXXX (director and co-author). This is a retake on the Shakespeare "comedy", but utterly removed from the stage. Without much text, XXXXXXXX and star Cassavettes make visual a mid-life crisis of passion and purpose. Desperate to re-center himself, Cassavettes retreats to a remote Greek island--where the locals and the island itself weave a little magic. With XXXX XXXXX especially, XXXXX XXXXXXXX and XXXXX XXXXXXXX, this is an adult fantasy that is emotionally satisfying and visually gorgeous. And funny. It wasn't a big box office hit, but whenever it does come to DVD, it will sell.
