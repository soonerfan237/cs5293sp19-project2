This movie won a special award at Cannes for its acting and it's not difficult to see why. (A few spoilers - but for the ending, you'll have to watch the movie!) A simple story - in Moscow on the eve of war between Russia and Germany in WW II Veronika (XXXXXXX Samoilova) is in love with Boris (Aleksei Batalov) but they have a spat when she learns that he has enlisted in the army. Boris leaves for the front before XXXXXXXX can tell him she loves him. Boris is shot but his ultimate fate remains unknown to Veronika or his family. XXXX, Boris' cousin, rapes Veronika who feels obligated to marry him. Degraded and demeaned by the cowardly XXXX, Veronika clings to the hope that someday Boris will return. Superb camera-work and wonderful set pieces by director XXXXXXXXX. (For anyone interested in film technique another movie by XXXXXXXXX, I AM CUBA, has at least two superb set pieces - one of them a long tracking shot that begins with a funeral procession through the streets of Havana, rises two stories to a cigar factory, tracks though the window and follows the procession down a long, long avenue - all without a cut.) Superb acting, particularly by XXXXXXXXX and Vasili Merkuryev (as Boris' uncle) that is made all the more poignant by sheer understatement. A devastatingly romantic movie with a heart-stopping performance by XXXXXXXXX. (This movie is frequently linked with the other Russian classic Ballad Of A Soldier.)
