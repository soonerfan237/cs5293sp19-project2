This movie could have been a lot better than it was, if hadn't been a Disney Film. I thought that the young girl playing XXXXXXX was all right, you could tell that she was really trying to do the job right. The teenage XXXXXXX Temple wasn't right at all. I think that they should have spent last time on her childhood, the first hour should have been about the young XXXXXXX, then the last hour should have been about the older XXXXXXX. This was a boring movie, and not a good XXXXXXX Temple story.
