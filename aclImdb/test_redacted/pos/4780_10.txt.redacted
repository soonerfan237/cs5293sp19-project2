This was the first XXXXXX Mouse cartoon released and the first cartoon with sound. In the cartoon, XXXXXX does not yet wear gloves. He does not yet speak either. All he does is whistle and play music. The song that he plays is "Turkey in the Straw" using several farm animals as musical instruments. For example, he plays the teeth of a cow like a xylophone and pulls nursing piglets like an accordion keyboard. I taped this cartoon off of the Disney Channel and I think it is wonderful. It was based on a silent film starring XXXXXX Keaton entitled "Steamboat Bill, Jr."
