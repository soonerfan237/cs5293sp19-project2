First off, I absolutely loved this movie. As a XXXXX Crystal fan, I must say that I was expecting more comedic situations than I actually got. However, it was nice to see him in a role with more depth and emotion. His portrayal of talent agent XXXXX was brilliantly performed and uniquely him. In addition, XXXXXXXX Muresan (as Maximus) was superb in his first film role. When XXXXX goes to Romania to visit his client on location he has his world turned upside down. He never expected that he would accidentally find the one person who could change his life. XXXXX and Max's journey is unique and moving, and even humorous at times. Plus, the location in Czech Republic where parts of the film were shot, was absolutely beautiful. I have to say, this dramatic comedy had me feeling a variety of emotions. I thought it was excellent and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.
