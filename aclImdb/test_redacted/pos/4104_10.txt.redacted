It may be a remake of the 1937 film by XXXXX, but it is wrong to consider it only in that way! It was supposed to expose XXXXXX's novel in a completely different way. As a musical is excellent. The scenery is terrific, the characters good and anyone like "XXXXXXX Maltin" who considers the Bacharach music awful must be completely deaf! I strongly recommend it.
