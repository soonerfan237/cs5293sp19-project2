Musical bios are all cut of the same cloth. Hopeful struggles, succeeds and finally wins the girl, but this one - a life of Irish tenor, XXXXXXXX Olcott/Jack Chancellor - has more going for it than the usual trappings. It has great charm and great sincerity and is played beautifully by all concerned. XXXXXX Morgan is fine in the lead as is Arlene Dahl as his love interest. XXXXXX King's supporting performance as Lillian Russell is far better than Alice Faye's leading bio performance in the film dedicated to her career. XXXXXXX Frawley is touching as the aging tenor champion, XXXXXXX Scanlon, and Sara Allgood is lovely as Olcott's mother. XXXXXX Tobias, Ben Blue and Alan Hale lend good support. There are over 25 songs (a true treasure chest): Come Down My Evening Star; My XXXXXX's Blue Eyes; You Tell Me Your Dream; Wait Till The Sun Shines, XXXXXX; Will You Love Me In December?; By The Light Of The Silvery Moon; Minstrel Days; XXXXX Wolly Doodle; The Natchez and the Robert E. Lee; Miss Lindy Lou; If I'm Dreaming; Wee Rose of Killarney; Shake Hands; One Little Girl; A Little Bit of Heaven; Mary; Sweet Innescarren; Tiddely Um; When Irish Eyes Are Smiling; Mother Machree; The Kerey Fair; Room In My Heart; My Wild Irish Rose.<br /><br />Although the film only earned one Oscar nom -for Scoring - and deservedly, it also deserved nods for Art Direction and Costume Design - sumptuous and lovely in Technicolor.<br /><br />Reasons why this is not on video may be due to the large chunk of time spent within the Minstrel Show atmosphere -at least a quarter of the film - with a great deal of material quite politically INCORRECT for today's audiences. It's historically accurate, however.<br /><br />This is a true gem and very worth seeking out. It leaves one with a warm glow.
