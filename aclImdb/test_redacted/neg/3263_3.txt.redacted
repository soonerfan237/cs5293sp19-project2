Why is this one no good when the first one rocked? Try the fact that they attempted to replace XXXXXX Dangerfield with Jackie Mason! Please! That's like replacing the Beatles with XXXXX Al. XXXXX Quaid is the only one that saves this movie from a zero.<br /><br />However, don't let this stop you from watching the first movie which was outstanding.
