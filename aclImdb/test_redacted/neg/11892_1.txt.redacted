XXXX Riefenstahl would be embarrassed by the disgusting propaganda Moore tries to call "humor". That this movie, and XXXXX's other prevarications, actually attract admirers proves that, alas, it's possible to fool some of the people all of the time.<br /><br />Let's see if we can bait foreigners. Let's see if we can extol obsolete factories. Let's see if we can add to the sum of hatred in the world. Let's see if we can pretend we're funny. Let's see if we can out-isolationist XXXXXXX Lindbergh. The only thing XXXXX lacks in comparison to Lindbergh is a medal from GÃ¶ring.<br /><br />Admittedly, in this film, XXXXX had a bit of self-deprecation to his schtick. In this film, Moore mocks XXXXX Smith, CEO of General Motors, as an aloof, uncaring elitist. XXXXX could do that in 1989, but now that XXXXX has surrendered himself to aloof, uncaring elitism, this characterization of Roger Smith has an ironic twinge. Who really wouldn't rather be XXXXX's buddy than Michael Moore's?
