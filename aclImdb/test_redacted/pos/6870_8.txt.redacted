It's a shame House Calls isn't better known. Is it perhaps because the romantic leads are middle-aged, shopworn, and gun-shy, rather than oversexed teen-stars? Could be. If you're over 35, you'll probably get this comedy. If you're over 45, you're really going to get this comedy. If you're 25, wait until you're older to see it.<br /><br />The unlikely pairing of XXXXXXX and XXXXXXX works precisely because it is so unlikely. There's a wonderful line of XXXXXXX's that sums up what is happening between the two of them--"I like old broads because you don't have to explain who XXXXXX XXXXXXX is." (If that's not the exact line, it's close...)<br /><br />The premise of a sub-par hospital run by incompetents rings true. XXX XXXXXX's portrayal of a senile head surgeon is absolutely brilliant. It is impossible not to laugh out loud at his delivery. Subplots, if you can call them that, are fun too, like between XXXXXXX and XXXXXXX's teenage son. Everything hits just exactly the right tone. <br /><br />Okay, there's the bit where XXXXXXX has to wear women's clothing that's a bit over-the-top and an easy mark. But, still--it's Walter XXXXXXX in drag! It's funny!
