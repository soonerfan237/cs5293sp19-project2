Many people have the irritating habit of dying before completing a vital message, thus confusing the hero, not to mention the audience...<br /><br />Dr. XXX McKenna (XXXXX XXXXXXX) and his wife Jo, a former musical star (XXXXX Day) are vacationing in Morocco with their son, Hank (XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXX), when they meet XXX and Mrs. XXXXXXX, a British couple (Brenda de XXXXXX and XXXXXXX XXXXX). They are also befriended by a charming XXXXXXXXX, XXXXX XXXXXXX (XXXXXX XXXXX), who invites them to dinner but then cancels at the last minute...<br /><br />The MacKennas go to a restaurant and end up having their meal with the XXXXXXXs, when they spot XXXXX XXXXXXX... <br /><br />The next day in the market place, they are caught in an assassination intrigue... While they are wandering in the local market, the crowds suddenly scatter to reveal an XXXX fleeing from his pursuers... Dr. McKenna stands amazed as the XXXX falls into his arms, a knife sticking out of his back... <br /><br />Gulping his last breath, the dying man mutters some words and collapses... Dr. McKenna is completely taken aback when the XXXX's hood falls from his head and he is revealed as XXXXXXX in disguise... McKenna is left knowing too little, but as far as the assassins are concerned, too much...<br /><br />To prevent Dr. McKenna from revealing what he knows, the conspirators kidnap his son as a hostage... The film is primarily concerned with the dilemma of kidnappinghow to get the little boy back safely... The subplot about the assassination is just the setup...<br /><br />The film is a breathless escapade... The death of XXXXXXX comes suddenly and points out that death comes when we least expect it... <br /><br />XXXXXXX is charged with emotion as the Midwestern doctor, accidentally involved in political intrigue... His perceptive facial expressions and indignant delivery made him convincingly humana person we could easily identify with... It is his temperament that actually sets the pace for the entire film... <br /><br />By 1956, the lovely XXXXX Day had won increasing esteem as an actress as well as a singer... She had been particularly strong opposite XXXXX XXXXXX in the Ruth Etting's biopic, 'Love Me or XXXXX XX,' but she was still unsure of her basic Thespian talents...<br /><br />The casting of character actor XXXXXX XXXXXX as the assassin, is brilliant... The man looks like a menace and his effusive portrayal radiates evil...
