I want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary, it is obviously a labor of love and I think they did a pretty good job of putting together an enjoyable documentary about a person who has had so such little info available about him. It definitely has a fan worship feel about it, which is a good thing.<br /><br />I had heard of XXXXX Haack but didn't know much about him, and I found the start of this documentary frustrating because I could hear other musicians talk about him, but XXXXX Haack himself was kept way too far off in the distance. I wanted to see this XXXXX Haack guy!! I felt as though the makers assumed I already knew him as well as these musicians on the screen which I didn't, so I felt a bit left in the dark.<br /><br />When XXXXX was finally shown in action it was great and gave me a taste of who XXXXX Haack was, but it was only a taste. We got treated to more musicians and I felt as though I was being told "XXXX - all these cool musicians are into him, so he must be cool!" I didn't really care much for the musician's commentary on XXXXX.<br /><br />I wanted to see XXXXX, as a person. You know, the important stuff - more interviews with people who worked with him or knew him. More about his life, and yes, his use of drugs and other issues. I would of liked to know so much more about his "XXXXXXX" project. I wanted to get inside his mind. Even if they did this via some "voice of god" commentary and photos it would of been OK.<br /><br />The animations were good, but again I felt these were used as filler, they didn't really do anything other than allow me to hear his music and see some imagery based on the Dimension 5 records. I did think it was clever and creative, but again... I wanted to learn more about XXXXX! <br /><br />Maybe XXXXX Haack was this elusive in real life?<br /><br />Anyway - in the end I enjoyed this documentary and felt a sort of sadness that such amazing pioneers and geniuses such as Mr. Haack get forgotten as the march of time stamps ever onwards. I am glad that this film is around to educate people about XXXXX Haack, even with its flaws.
