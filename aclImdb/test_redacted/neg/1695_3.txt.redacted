Maybe this wowed them in the 50's, but this is one of those flicks that doesn't age well. It's got that preachy, earnest, downtrodden working man vibe of a 2nd rate XXX Serling live TV "Playhouse" broadcast.

If I had to work with this guy in a warehouse I'd probably want to hit him with a grappling hook too. XXXX Warden is good, because as usual, he plays XXXX Warden.<br /><br />Like 90% of the films rated on IMDb (whether they are classics, mediocre or crapola) somehow this one gets rated with 7-point-some-stars.
