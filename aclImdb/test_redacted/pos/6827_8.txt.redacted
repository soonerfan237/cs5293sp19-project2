XXXX and Kate meet the physician XXXXXX XXXXXX first and then the psychics XXXXX XXXXXXX and they demonstrate that have not come to the island with the intention of rescuing the survivors. Locke and his group find the anthropologist XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXX XXXXX, and XXX XXXXX shoots her. Meanwhile, the group of XXXX finds the pilot XXXXX XXXXXXX, who landed the helicopter with minor damages that can be repaired. XXXX forces XXXXX to tell the real intention why they have come to the island.<br /><br />The second episode of the Fourth Season returns to the island, with four new characters, stops the confusing "flash-forwards" and it seems that will finally be the beginning of the explanations that I (and most of the fans and viewers) expect to be provided in "Lost". Why the interest of the government in XXX XXXXX, and how he is informed from the boat are some of the questions that I expect to see in the next episodes. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): Not Available
