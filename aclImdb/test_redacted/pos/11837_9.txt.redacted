toplines this ok comedy about an aging father (C. XXXXXX Smith) who decides to gather his grown children from around the world. Davies is working as a chorus girl in New York when she gets the news that "daddy" wants her. Hmmmm, sounds familiar. XXXXXX' considerable talents as a comedienne save this otherwise so-so comedy as she upsets the staid British countryside with her brazen American personality. Not as sharp as some other Davies comedies, but still worth a look. XXX Milland plays her long-lost "brother." XXXXX Lloyd, Elizabeth Murray, and Halliwell Hobbes are all fun, too.
