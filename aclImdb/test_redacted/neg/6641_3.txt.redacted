This movie is stupid. There's no getting around it. But so is XXXX and XXXXer. Mind you, XXXX and XXXXer is significantly more funny than this. However, I for one love seeing stupid movies (XXXX Sting) and laughing with a group of good friends over how bad it is. Call me callous, but see this movie, and you'll find that the only way you can laugh at it is if you laugh at it instead of with it.
