I love military comedies (Sgt. Bilko, XXXXXXX, In The Army Now, Major Payne) and Down Periscope is hilarious, but it has a heart as well.<br /><br />The Stingray SS-161 (The USS Pampanito) was gorgeous. Absolutely beautiful, a piece of art come alive. So it was a diesel engine sub, so what? I learned that the Aircraft Carrier USS XXXXXX (which stood in for The Enterprise in Star Trek IV), a huge ship, was 'conventionally powered', which might mean that XXXXXX was a diesel too.<br /><br />My favorite scene: Pascal: Jesus, Buckman, this can's been on the stingray since Korea! This can expired in 1966! Buckman: (XXXXX finger full and tastes it) What's the matter, sir? It still tastes like creamed corn.<br /><br />Pascal: (Yelling) Except, it's DEVILED HAM!! Buckman: That would be a problem.<br /><br />It's story, perhaps a wee strained, seemed plausible. XXXXXXX respected Dodge, and seemed to care about him, so he wanted to give Dodge a chance. He gave him a battered but still seaworthy Balao-class sub, and assigns him the task of using the diesel sub to evade the nuclear Navy and 'attack' XXXXXXXXX Harbor, and Norfolk. 2-star Admiral Graham (with his eye on his third star, and a grudge against XXXXX) assigned him the ragtag crew, hoping that they would screw up so XXXXX would lose. Can XXX Dodge get the crew up to speed and working as a team, and can he take an old, out of date sub, and beat the Navy's best?
