I love the Thackeray novel on which this film is based. And while this modern version of XXXXX XXXXX's story is a B film, the casting of XXX, in her first top-billed role, is rather fascinating.<br /><br />Before XXX became MGM's reigning good girl in scores of genteel and comic roles, she was an actress. VANITY FAIR was XXX's follow-up film to EMMA, in which she played a snotty and greedy daughter who almost destroys the loyal housekeeper (XXXXX XXXXXXXX).<br /><br />XXX's XXXXX is much nastier than XXXXXX XXXXXXX' version 3 years later in BECKY SHARP. XXX's XXXXX is very much a pre-Code film character with her plunging necklines and amoral ways. It's the type of character that XXXX XXXXXX or XXXXX XXX could easily have played, but XXXXX here is still supposed to be of the genteel set. That's what makes her fallen character so tragic.<br /><br />In counterpoint to XXX's grasping XXXXX is the goody goody Amelia (XXXXXXX XXXX) who is just not an interesting character. XXXX Forbes is icily good as Mrs. Sedley. Most of the other actors in this version are pretty blah: XXXXXX XXXXXX as Rawdon; XXXXXX XXXXX as Osborne; XXXXXXX XXXXXXX as XXXXXX. Others are nearly Dickensian is their quirkiness: Billy XXXXX as Joseph; Lionel Belmore as Crawley; XXXXXXX XXXX as the Marquis; XXXXXX XXXXX as Polly the maid; XXXXXXX XXXXXXX as the housekeeper.<br /><br />XXX is front and center throughout. While the ending is rather shocking, she has several excellent scenes, such as the gambling scene in the casino where she tries to steal another woman's winning roulette bet. The more XXX's XXXXX descends morally, the more beautiful she gets until she is finally "caught." Bottom line here is that this is a very solid performance by XXX in a film that should be seen.
