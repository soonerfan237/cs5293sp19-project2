Many reviewers seem to prefer the original version of The Man XXX XXXX XXX XXXX, which I have not had the opportunity to view. By itself, the '56 version is a very well done film. The run of mid-to-late fifties XXXXXcock films (including "Rear Window", "XXXX X For XXXXXX", "Vertigo", and "To Catch A Thief", as well as this film) is one of my favorite periods in his career. In The Man XXX XXXX XXX XXXX, XXXXX XXXXXXX throws himself vigorously into his role as always. XXXXX Day is very believable in the role of an atypical XXXXXcock blond. I thought there was nothing fake about her performance. Her character may not have been written as strongly as the original, but she's definitely not reduced to the role of a passive, "Yes, dear", pretty thing on XXXXX XXXXXXX's arm.<br /><br />There were some really clever lines written for Hank (the couple's son who later gets kidnapped) in the opening scene on the bus- it's too bad Christopher XXXXX read them so woodenly. It's rare to see a good performance from a child actor in the 50s, though. Most of the rest of the supporting actors in this film were very competent, though- most notably the assassin (played by XXXXXX XXXXXX). <br /><br />Some little touches that make this film undeniably XXXXXcockian- the use of non-English dialog, especially French (something XXXXX did on a much larger scale in "To Catch A Thief"); the use of foreboding, XXXXXX music in the hotel when the assassin appears; XXXXXXX and Day talking to each other in the church, singing their words to the tune of the hymn; the XXXXXX XXXX scene, specifically showing the musicians and the assassin's accomplice following the score, building up tension, as well as the percussionist getting the cymbals ready; and finally the assassin's gun as it appears from behind the curtain. It moves so slowly and precisely that it must have been done mechanically (an effect XXXXX used at the end of "Spellbound", also).<br /><br />All in all, The Man XXX XXXX XXX XXXX is a fun film to watch. It's not as deep or as heavily laden with symbolism as some of his films ("Vertigo", "Strangers on a Train"), but all the same it is one of my top five XXXXXcock masterpieces.
