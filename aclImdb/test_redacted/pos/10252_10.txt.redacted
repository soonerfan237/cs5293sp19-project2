XXXXXX XXXX was actually a drama with moments of comedy. It was a reflection of high school life back in the day. I attended Coolidge XXXX in Washington, D.C. from 1976 to 1979 and much of what was in XXXXXX XXXX was an every day thing at Coolidge. As a matter of fact after the movie came out everybody started calling Coolidge "XXXXXX XXXX." Getting high, shooting dice, chasing girls, basement parties, and fights, that sums up high school life for many in D.C. back in the day. I can't forget XXXXXX because XXXXXX music began and ended many a day back in the 70s. The hits just kept coming. However, XXXXXX XXXX adds a layer of humanity over the craziness because when all was said and done just like in XXXXXX XXXX my classmates and I had a lot of love for each other. And like the characters in XXXXXX XXXX there was life after high school, but there was nothing like waking up every morning and experiencing each day to the fullest from homeroom to seventh period. Thirty years later we are getting ready to celebrate those good times. XXXXXX XXXX is definitely a period piece that just gets better with time because like it or not the only thing left from those days are memories, some good, and some bad.
