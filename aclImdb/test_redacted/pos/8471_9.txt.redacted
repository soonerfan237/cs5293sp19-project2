I'm not saying anything new when I say that "Ray" was magnificent. As I proceed to laud this movie I have to mention something that sets it apart from other films. Very rarely is a film made entirely by the actor(s). "Ray" quite simply was made by XXXXX Foxx. Without the wonderful performance of XXXXX Foxx, "Ray" would just be another interesting and informative biopic. I always thought XXXX was funny, stemming from his days with "In Livin' Color" and "The Jamie XXXX Show", and I also knew that he was talented, as he used his own show ("The Jamie XXXX Show") to show off his musical talents. But never did I imagine that he could pull off a role like this. I don't know much about acting and what they go through to get into character or other things like that, but what I saw from XXXXX Foxx was extremely impressive. He wrapped himself into that role and made us see XXX Charles rather than an actor portraying XXX Charles. The story of "Ray" was great yes, but it was given life by XXXXX Foxx.
