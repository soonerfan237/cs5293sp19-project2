Many films attempt the ambitious. Few succeed. This film is one of them.<br /><br />Though billed as a black comedy, that term seems too limiting to express the true nature of the story behind XXX and XXXXX. Multi-hyphenate XXXXXXX XXXXXXX has managed to weave elements of absurdest comedy with incredibly real human emotion. Quite a remarkable feat, to be certain.<br /><br />While the comedic aspects are certainly present, the heart of the film lies in its leads: XXXXX XXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXX XXXXXX. The delicate balance of the film - really crazy versus real love - falls to them and they achieve it, carrying it through from the opening scene to the heart wrenching climax and on to the heartwarming ending. XXXXX XXXXXXXXX, in the titular lead role and as narrator, anchors the picture and does an exceptional job. We see the world through XXX's eyes and Krumholtz imbues them with a sort of wonder and hopefulness that one would not expect to be believable coming from a character who had previously attempted suicide. There should be no doubt from this point on that he has truly achieved leading man status, well deserved after more than a decade of memorable supporting roles. XXXXXXX XXXXXX might be something of a revelation for anyone who has seen her only in less challenging roles. The role of XXXXX is expansive in scope, requiring her to show both great rage and great tenderness - sometimes within seconds of each other. She manages to convince us of XXXXX's deep seated desperation that lies just beneath her alternating torpor and mania.<br /><br />This is not a laugh a minute type of comedy so don't see the film expecting strictly humor from start to finish. Think more dramedy than comedy. There are some very dark moments, as one would expect given the subject matter of suicidal individuals, and some oddly real moments delivered most notably by XXXX XXXXX XXXXXX as XXX's sister, XXX. The most humorous scenes are those populated by the myriad of name actors in supporting roles. While XXXXXXXX XXXXXX and XXXXX XXXXXX lend the most surreal aspect with their scenes the other supporting characters who populate the institution where XXX and XXXXX meet are the real treat. XXXXXXXXX Diaz is a wanton scene stealer as the delightfully frenetic oddball, XXXXXX. XXXX Moeller, as XXXXX, acts as his straight man but has his own charm and appeal. XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX fully inhabits the role of Vera with the crass vitriol of an embittered truck stop waitress. Even her hardhearted character melts eventually, as does everyone who is touched by XXX's literally undying love for XXXXX.<br /><br />Can love conquer all might be the question behind the film and even though the realist within says no, movies are about an escape from reality, even if only for a few brief hours. I recommend seeing this film as an antidote to not just reality but to the cynicism that says that a love story like this never happens. Spending a few hours immersed in a world where it can and does works wonders on the psyche.<br /><br />(Seattle International Film Festival - June 2005)
