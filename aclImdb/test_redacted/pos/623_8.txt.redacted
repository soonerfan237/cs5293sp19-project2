Superbly crafted low-budget thriller with more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at, and plenty of ghoulish humour along the way as well.<br /><br />The cast play it very well, although XXXXXXXX' self-centered movie director is a bit hard to take at times. The tiny two-scene cameo by XXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, oozing menace as the crime czar of Moscow, is simply the icing on the cake.<br /><br />Well worth repeated viewing, but not on dark nights when you're all alone!
