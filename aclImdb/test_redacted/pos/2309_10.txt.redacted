especially when looking at the amount of crap that has made it to DVD. I found this movie very funny. XXX Torn is classic with his barbs; XXX XXXXXXXXX if hilariously annoying as the over-compensating Ensign; XXXXX XXXX makes a great "villain". The entire cast seems to be having a blast, and it's not at the expense of the audience. If you like just plain fun comedy, and aren't looking too deeply into meaning, you just might fall in love with this one.
