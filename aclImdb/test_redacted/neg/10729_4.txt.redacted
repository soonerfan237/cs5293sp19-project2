XXXX and Jane Harper (Jim Carrey, Téa Leoni) wind up on the unemployment line when the corporation XXXX works for is caught in a corruption scandal, and after desperately and unsuccessfully trying to find jobs, the duo turns to crime in order to get them out of poverty.<br /><br />I've always been a fan of Jim Carrey. It's been awhile since he has made a straight up comedy. The last one was XXXXX Almighty which was pretty good. He has proved that he can do serious dramas but comedy is his real element. Fun with XXXX and Jane proves that he still has it. Even though the film was funny, it was still kind of disappointing. It wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. It's worth watching once though unlike most of XXXXXX's movies, it doesn't have a good repeat value. Part of the problem is the script. I was surprised the script was weak since this is the same guy that made The Forty Year Old Virgin. Some of the jokes just fall flat and other times they seem to be trying too hard. If XXX Carrey wasn't in it, than the film would have been a lot worse.<br /><br />Next to XXX Carrey is Téa Leoni. She's an okay actress but she just isn't very funny. She doesn't match up well with XXXXXX and she seemed to be phoning in her performance. They should have gone with someone else. The supporting cast includes XXXX Baldwin, Richard Jenkins and Aaron Michael Jenkins. The latter plays XXXXX Harper and he actually gives a decent performance. He wasn't as annoying as most child stars are. XXXX Baldwin was okay and Richard Jenkins tried too hard to be funny. To be honest, I'm a little bias here. The film altogether was pretty average but I liked it more because of XXX Carrey's performance. Fans of XXX Carrey should enjoy it but that's about it. In the end, XXX with Dick and Jane is a fun way to spend 90 minutes but its not very memorable. Rating 6/10
