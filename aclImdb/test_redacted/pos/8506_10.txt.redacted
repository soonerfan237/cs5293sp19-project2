I like both this version of DORIAN GRAY and the MGM version. Both add a little girl early in the story who grows up to have an association with Dorian (this is not in the original book), and that is my only complaint. I especially like XXXXXX XXXXXXXX as XXXXX XXXX and XXXXXX XXXXXXX as XXXXX in the MGM version, but XXXXX XXXXXX as Dorian in the TV-version is much better looking (I think) and far more ruthless than XXXX XXXXXXXX in the MGM version: I think Briant is more true to the novel's Dorian. In the end, this is a very good adaptation of the novel (it even hints at Dorian's liaison's with men, as does XXXXX, which could not be done in the MGM version).
