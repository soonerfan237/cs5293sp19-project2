Watch this movie .....only to truly appreciate how good the original is. I'm not real hard to please, but this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /><br />It hurt me deeply, because I like XXXXX Chase, Jackie Mason, and Dyan Cannon. The writing was just terrible! I thought XXXXX would have at least ad libbed some better stuff than he did. There was hardly anything to laugh at in this movie. I went into it wanting to enjoy it. I wanted to laugh but nearly cried. <br /><br />In the beginning credits it read Special Appearance by XXXXX Chase. This worried me from the start. Chevy is actually in more than I thought he would be. It's more than a "special appearance". Too bad the appearance wasn't special. XXXXX's character would have been a good secondary character but got old as a main. I would rather have seen more (much more)of XXXX Cannon. At least her character was fun, if not well written. I also missed the gratuatis teen sex scene. XXX Gopher went from being cute and innocent to a pesky rodent that deserved to be blown up. XXXXXXXX Silverman is the only character that interested me and we didn't see enough of him.<br /><br />I take it back. Try..to watch half of this movie, then...remember the Alamo, the Maine, and CaddyShack I.
