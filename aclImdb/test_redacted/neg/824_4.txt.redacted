If I compare two films with XXXXX Cohen, Borat and Ali G then Ali G is immeasurably better. I'ts no master piece, but it's a film at least. Borat is complete garbage and I do not understand how it rated better then XXX G.<br /><br />I cannot put my finger on it, there something wrong with the XXX G script: half of the jokes are as if written by a 15 years old, not by an adult scriptwriter. And a number of jokes including Mr XXXXX's lower body are quite tasteless. <br /><br />But the film actually comes together as a comedy and there are some valid jokes too that are funny: such as how XXX G becomes a member of government for doing something scandalous and stupid in the public (sadly true in today's western society: people get careers for doing stupid things in public), also XXX's advice about immigrant policy and some others. <br /><br />Ali G overall remains a sympathetic character, even though a kind of mentally underdeveloped for his age. But it's OK to watch,it's quite funny.<br /><br />But never ever watch XXXXX, it's awful and makes every intelligent movielover sick.
