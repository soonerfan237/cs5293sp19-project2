XXXXXX (2006), written and directed by XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX, is an extraordinary film from South India. XXXXXXX Bhukya plays 15-year-old XXXXXX, who lives in a rural area with her loving but alcoholic father. If she is going to succeed in life, she will have to overcome the liabilities of low caste and poverty. <br /><br />I went to the film expecting the depiction of an wretched girl who is crushed by society. This isn't what "XXXXXX" shows us. The young woman is attractive, intelligent, and ambitious. She won't accept her fate with tears or simple resignation. She wants to succeed, and it's never clear that she won't succeed, despite the odds. <br /><br />The acting that XXX XXXXXXXXXX draws forth from his cast of amateurs is miraculous. XXXXXXX Bhukya is outstanding in the title role, and XXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX does an exceptional job as Mrs. Rama Devi, the wealthy landowner who is a formerly famous classical dancer.<br /><br />In the film XXXXXX learns South Indian classical dance, as she did in real life. I couldn't tell how good XXXXXX's dancing was by Indian standards, but the many dance scenes were spellbinding. (Don't think XXXXXXXXX--this is classical dance. It's also very different from ballet, because in ballet the dancer lifts her heels away from the floor. In Sound Indian dance, the heel is the primary contact point.)<br /><br />This is a movie that is not to be missed. It will work on DVD, but will be better on a theater screen because the dancing will be shown to better advantage. However, if DVD is your only option, then see it that way. Just be sure to see it.
