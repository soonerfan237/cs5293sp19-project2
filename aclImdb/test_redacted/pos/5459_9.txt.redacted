The Late Shift is a great book, I read the book several years ago, and I was transfixed at the cutthroat debauchery that went on when XXXXXX XXXXXX retired and XXX XXXX and XXXXXX XXXXXX tried to grab his spot. When the movie came out, I snagged a VHS copy of the movie, and having reread the book recently, it's hard to say which I enjoy more, because they're quite equal in the amount of information conveyed. The two lead actors, XXXX XXXXXXX XXXXXXX, and XXXXXX XXXXXXX, two actors I never heard of before, and haven't heard of since, play XXXX and XXXXXXXXX convincingly, despite XXXXXXXXX's dismissal of his portrayal as being poor. They play the parts quite well, despite a lot of people looking for an imitation of the two. I wasn't as interested in that. The story is what counts. And that brings me to XXXXX XXXXX. XXXXX XXXXX, playing XXXXX XXXXXXXX, IS this movie. She plays this evil bitch of a character so menacingly you realize how on earth can this woman control herself, much less a national TV show. Yikes! There should be a sequel!!
