The movie is a starter to what really happened in XXXXXX City. I'm a grandchild of the people who really lived the story. The truth never has come out to my knowledge. I have tried to find the whole story out but the people who lived it are still scared to tell it. XXXXXX City is still run by crooked people. XXXXXX XXXXXXXXX was not quite the saint the story wants you to believe. The story was filmed in XXXXXX City. It still has some of the famous sites in it that you see in the movie. The Colonal Funeral Home still looks exactly the same. But if you are wanting the real history of XXX XXXX you have to visit us and find people willing to tell you about Ma beachies and her kindness. She didn't get the name ma for nothing.
