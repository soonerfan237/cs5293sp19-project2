This was a really interesting Halloween film. I wasnt to thrilled with the whole Thorn theory but it still makes for a good film. I liked getting to see XXXXX XXXXX back but sadly XXXXXX XXXXXXXXX died right after shooting. The film had a really REALLY bad director who didnt give a flip about the series, from what I heard treated XXXXXX bad, and wouldnt let XXXXXXXX XXXXXX come back as XXXXX. Its like he was just trying to bring down the film, but I still liked it. There were alot of cuts and music changes and if you're lucky you can get the Producers Cut which features over 40 min. of never before scenes. With those scenes it turns into a whole new movie. Check it out if you have the chance.
