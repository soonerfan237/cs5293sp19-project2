This must be one of the funniest Danish movies ever made. XXXXXX Thomsen and XXXXXX XX XXXXXX are hilarious, as they drive across Sweden. I don't know how XXXXXX Thomsen does it, but somehow he can manage to play insane in a very sane way. BUT if you don't understand Danish (I am not referring to your pastry here) don't waste your time on this Â– I don't think it would work with subtitles.
