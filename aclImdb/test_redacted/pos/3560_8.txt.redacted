"Any Gun Can Play" (1967), directed by XXXX XX XXXXXXXXXX, is a very good pastiche of XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX, especially XXXXX's. The first half is great, which, apart from the opening which is a direct nod to "For a Few Dollars More", with XXXXX, Colonel Douglas Mortimer and XX XXXXX lookalikes walking into a ghost-town and then promptly killed by a Bounty Hunter called "The Stranger", is entirely serious, with great gunfights (especially the train-robbing scene), fast and furious action and nice performances from XXXXXXX XXXXXX, XXXXXX XXXXXX and (who manages well, considering that he is badly miscast) XXX XXXXXX. But then, when the film reaches the half-way mark, there is a jokey fist-fight between XXXXXX and XXXXXX. It isn't very funny, and is the weakest part of the film, but it throws everything you have seen previously in a new light. You realise that in fact the whole thing is a spoof of Spaghetti Western conventions, and in retrospect, the first half is so well done that you completely miss this spoof undercurrent. What now follows is a more obvious parody, with even some acrobatic jumping around from XXXXXX that predates all those seventies XXXXXX XXXXXXXX. The ending, a complete send-up of "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" climax, is very well done, as in other hands it could have been very silly. So, a pretty fun Spaghetti Western, that doesn't take itself too seriously. I would recommend it to anyone who likes XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX.
