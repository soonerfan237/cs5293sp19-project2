All the boys seem to be sexually aroused by XXXXX Lane. All the girls seem to be jealous of XXXXX Lane. But, nothing seems to become of it, and this viewer wonders why? XXXXX is beautiful and a magnet to every boy she meets, but we never get to know XXXXX or any of the characters in the film. XXXXX accepts an invitation, from her student friends, to go to a secluded ranch. Three boys and three girls drink and drug. In the film, the teenagers drink booze like its water, and take drugs to experience a psychedelic trip. And, there is absolutely no sex. In the meantime, the teenagers disappear one by one. But, the others are all drunk and high. Nobody, including those watching the film, cares or is at all concerned. Nobody, including the audience, seems to give a damn. Emmet, a fellow student, is the instigator of the entire event. There is a security guard, Garth (dashingly and handsomely played by XXXXX Mount), who guards and protects the ranch. Midway through the film, the killer is revealed, the tension is suddenly released like air let out of a balloon. The events are completely predictable, and the film just completely fizzles out. XXXXX meets her match, but we don't ever know why--and, at the end of the film, there is still no sex. XXXX Mandy hypnotize the boys, or does she simply bore all of the boys and girls to their deaths? This absolutely-confused viewer can only conclude that XXXXX wishes to get rid of the female and male competition--by killing off the manipulative girls and the nasty boys.<br /><br />Is XXXXX worth all of the attention? The director (XXXXXXXX Levine) seems to think so, but this viewer does not. The able cinematographer (XXXXXX Genet) provides some stunning images but, in fact, his focus seems to be on Garth, who is quite the stud. Not all of the boys love XXXXX, or do they? If you want to be bored enough to find out how this film winds up, my advice is to sleep midway through film, until you see the temptress XXXXX and Garth's bulging crotch. But, don't wait for anything to happen. Yep, you guessed it. XXXXX remains a virgin, and there's still no sex. I rank this film a 3 out of 10, but not because of Mandy. Why? Because all of the girls love XXXXX, and all voyeuristic eyes seem to be on XXXXX in a compromising position. But unfortunately, girls and boys, this film never seems to get beyond a disappointing and incomplete sexual fantasy. Mandy goes to a secluded ranch, and nothing sexual ever happens. The audience is led to horror on a ranch--and cannot help, but wonder why?
