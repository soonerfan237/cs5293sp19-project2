This is another enjoyable and entertaining XXXXXXXXX film. XXXXX XXXXXXX and XXXXX Day are incredible in this movie. XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX appears as himself near the climax.<br /><br />The scenery and locations are great, except the one scene early on where the background was obviously fake, which doesn't make sense to me since scenes before and after were in the same setting and they were real location shots. I've heard that XXXXXXXXX did this on purpose sometimes.<br /><br />The reviews for this movie seem to be mixed. I think this is a better than average XXXXXXXXX movie. Very entertaining and it has a great light comical scene at the end.<br /><br />I rated this movie 8 out of 10.<br /><br />
