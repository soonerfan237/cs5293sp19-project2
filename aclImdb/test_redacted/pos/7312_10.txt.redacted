A rich old lady calls on a flirtatious divorc√©e to woo a Lothario away from her silly soon-to-be-married granddaughter.<br /><br />LET US BE GAY is an interesting little domestic comedy which features some tart dialogue (courtesy of celebrated screenwriter XXXXXXX XXXXXX) & good performances. While perhaps a bit mawkish at times, this can probably be blamed on the difficulties with early sound technology which tended to limit action & movement.<br /><br />Norma XXXXXXX can be credited with appearing in this minor film, rather than using her undoubted clout as Irving Thalberg's spouse to insist upon only A-grade pictures. She is especially effective in her first few scenes, where dowdy flat makeup makes her almost unrecognizable. Her extreme transmogrification from goose to swan could only happen in XXXXXXXXX, but it's scarcely profitable to spend much time worrying about that.<br /><br />Rod LaRocque doesn't come off too well as XXXXXXX's adulterous husband. Quite popular during Silent days, the talkies were not especially kind to him and his career would suffer. Here his role is not in the least sympathetic and one has to wonder what masochistic impulse moves women to desire the cad so much.<br /><br />Magnificent XXXXX XXXXXXXX is on hand as an eccentric Long Island dowager. As a great friend of XXXXXXX XXXXXX, one can easily imagine that the part was written expressly for her. Full of cranks & crotchets, she is very humorous. However, the tremendous warmth & essential goodness which would very shortly make her XXXXXXXXX's biggest star are largely missing.<br /><br />Among the supporting cast, XXXXX XXXXXX scores as a slinky society serpent, as does XXXXXXX XXX playing a comic butler. Movie mavens will spot little XXXXXX XXXXX as XXXXXXX's young son & elderly XXXX XXXXXX as her housekeeper, both uncredited.
