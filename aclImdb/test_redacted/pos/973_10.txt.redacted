This is one of the funniest movies I've ever saw. A 14-year old boy XXXXX Shepherd wrote an English paper called "Big Fat Liar". When his skateboard was taken, he had to use his sister's bike to get to the college on time and he hit a limo. When he went into the limo, he met a famous producer from Hollywood, XXXXX Wolf. When he left the limo, he forgot one thing: his paper! So XXXXX Wolf took it and he turned Jason's English paper into a movie! When XXXXX admitted that he left his paper in the limo and Marty took it, his parents and his English teacher didn't believe him! So XXXXX and his friend Kaylee had to fly to Los Angeles to go to Hollywood to make Marty admit he stole his story to XXXXX's parents. When XXXXX told Marty to call his dad that Marty stole that paper, Marty tricked him and burned his paper! XXXXX got so angry that Marty burned that paper so Marty called security to get XXXXX out of his site! XXXXX and Kaylee realized Marty isn't going to admit the truth. In order to take XXXXX down in Phase 2: The Takedown, Jason and Kaylee put permanent blue dye into the pool and when XXXXX jumps in, his body turns all blue and it wouldn't come off! Then they put permanent orange dye in Marty's shampoo and when he uses it, his hair turns all orange and it wouldn't come off too! Finally, they put lots of glue on XXXXX's earpiece to make him call Jason's father and when XXXXX uses it, it sticks to his ear! It was funny when XXXXX's hair and body turns all blue and orange and his headset is glued to his ear! After that, they tricked XXXXX by telling Monty, who is XXXXX's assistant, that Duncan moved to a house where there's a party going on. When XXXXX went in to see Duncan, he was at the wrong house and all the kids at the party beat him up! When XXXXX was in the house, Jason and Kaylee switched the controls of his car. When XXXXX drove his car, he knew all the controls were switched and he didn't know which button to push. He's stupid enough to fall for it. When XXXXX hit the rear end of the masher, the masher wrecked his car! It was so funny. So Marty starts to call XXXXX's dad and tricked him again! He was on the phone, but it wasn't his father, he called security! After the security got XXXXX and Kaylee out of Marty's site, they suggested them to go home. XXXXX was going to be on Jason and Kaylee's side cause she knew that Marty was a liar and a jerk so she told Rocco, who is one of the security guards that she will take care of the kids. XXXXX told his father the truth of what he's been up to for the past 2 days and had his parents come to L.A. When XXXXX came to the kids, she's going to help the kids move into Phase 4: The Payback. XXXXX splits the crew into 3 teams for Phase 4. One team will distract and trick XXXXX until Jason's parents get to the set. XXXXX first rode with Frank Jackson, but his car broke down so he rode with Jaleel, but he took him into the desert and leave him there. When XXXXX was in the desert, a helicopter came to rescue him. After that, one of the blades are jammed so XXXXX and the pilot got off the helicopter. After that, he was on the way to the set and when XXXXX saw him, Marty stopped and saw what XXXXX has: his monkey! So XXXXX went after Jason and Kaylee and when they saw Lester, he released the water and when the water came, it pushed XXXXX away. XXXXX was still after the kids and when Kaylee went the other way, Jason led XXXXX to the top of the apartment building. At the top, XXXXX was challenging Marty by making him admit the truth and Marty will never ever tell the truth. When the crew caught XXXXX in surprise, all the people including Jason's parents who were at the set knew what XXXXX did. XXXXX was going to kill Jason but the only way for Jason to escape is jump down from the top! After that, his parents believed him that XXXXX took his story. When the people who were on the set left, this is the end of Marty. At the end, XXXXX's story, Big Fat Liar was a movie. I cant get enough of it.
