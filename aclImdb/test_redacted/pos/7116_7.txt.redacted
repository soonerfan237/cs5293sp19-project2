House of XXXXXXX works from the same basic premise as House of XXXXXXXXXXXX from the year before; namely that XXXXXXXXX's three most famous monsters; XXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXX's XXXXXXX and The Wolf Man are appearing in the movie together. Naturally, the film is rather messy therefore, but the fact that all three monsters are there is usually enough to ensure that the film's sixty seven minutes don't become boring. It's obvious that the idea of making another monster mash came into the writer's head before an actual plot did, as the yarn we're given isn't exactly without holes. The plot sees Count XXXXXXX arrive at Dr. XXXXXXX's home asking for a cure for his vampirism. Then, what can only be described as a coincidence, sees XXXXXXXX XXXXXX, a.k.a. The Wolf Man turn up asking for a cure for his affliction! It turns out that XXXXXXX is on the prowl for XXXXXXX's daughter, but XXXXXX really is serious. When it turns out that he can't be stopped from turning into a wolf, The Wolf Man throws himself into the sea...where he ends up finding XXXXXXXXXXXX's XXXXXXX.<br /><br />Overall, this film isn't as good as the earlier House of XXXXXXXXXXXX. The 1944 film put its plot together better than this entry in the series does, as the plot here doesn't give equal time to each XXXXXXXXX monster. XXXXXXX's plot is the biggest at first, but soon fizzles out only to resurface at the end. The Wolf Man is the star of the show, but his story never really develops, and is essentially just another version of the plot he always finds himself in. XXXXXXXXXXXX's XXXXXXX is given the coldest hand, as he appears in the movie merely as an afterthought, and an obvious excuse to ensure that all three monsters appear in the movie. The story of the doctor who binds all three together is the most interesting, but this is a little disappointing as he isn't the reason why people will see this film. The acting is good enough, with XXXX XXXXXXXXX showing his sinister side and XXX XXXXXX XX once again making sure that his character is bathed in tragedy. XXXXX XXXXXXX is given nothing to do, and XXXXXX XXXXXXX proves the real highlight as Dr XXXXXXX. Overall, this film won't do much for anyone that isn't a fan of XXXXXXXXX horror; but as silly monster movies go, House of XXXXXXX is worth seeing.
