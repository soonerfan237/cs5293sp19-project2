This is a really silly job of miscasting--about as bad as XXXXXXX playing a Chinese woman in DRAGON SEED. The lead part XXXXXXX plays is a combination of Granny from the Beverly Hillbillies and a faith healer! This film is even worse than XXXXXX's Swing Your Lady, because at least XXXXXX didn't play a hillbilly--he was just surrounded by them. And the dialog sounds as if it comes right from a Li'l XXXXX strip! The problems don't really end with the outrageous casting, though, as the plot is completely muddled and the "love story" might make your head hurt. For no reason WHATSOEVER, married XXXXXX Young falls for this Ozark bobcat. Was it her lovely personality that won his heart? I doubt it, as she as the fiery "spitfire" the movie was named after and she really seemed to like fightin' and scrappin' and hollerin'! Was it her feminine charms? With no makeup and fashions that looked like they were designed by XX Kettle, I doubt if this was the case as well. To top this off, in the end, somehow XXXXX Bellamy also fell for her, though once again, it really doesn't seem to make ANY sense.<br /><br />So, here we have two city fellers fallin' for a scrappy unfeminine she-beast played by Ms. Hepburn--now THAT'S a recipe for a good film!
