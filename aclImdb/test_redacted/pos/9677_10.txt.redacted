When I first saw this show, I was 9, and it caught my attention right away when XXXXXX was trying to call XXXX on the phone in the hotel. I laughed and kept on watching. When the episode was finished, i wrote down the name of the cartoon and watched it regularly. This separates itself from the Simpsons and other shows on say, XXXXXXX XXXXXXX because the jokes are more mature, not too much, but it's TV-14 for a reason. The quick film cuts after each punch line and cute, funny movements and behavior of the characters make it special. Talented XXXX XXXXXXXXXX is the creator and the voice of quite a lot of characters in the show. A good theme song, and a crazy family that there's always something funny, makes this my favorite cartoon along Sealab 2021 and XXXX XXXX XXXXXX XXXXX. Check it out it's funny stuff.
