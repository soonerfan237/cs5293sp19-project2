I give this a 10 out of 10, not because the plot was hard to uncover because it wasn't... but because it leaves one caring for the characters. The acting, by all the cast, is superb, especially XXXX XXXXXXX, and it's a marvellous episode because of it's heart. <br /><br />Miss Marple is called upon by XXXXX XXXXXX's dying request to investigate, and solve, a murder that happened some seven or eight years previously, and she has to discover who, why and when as she goes along. Mr XXXXXX is the same XXXXXX as was in A Caribbean Mystery and so there is a sense of a connection here. <br /><br />XXXXXXX is definitely one for the amateur psychologists among us, and if you are one of those who is only happy with lots of blood, guts and rip-roaring action sequences, then you won't like it. But if you are like me, one who loves knowing about PEOPLE and discovering what makes them tick, then XXXXXXX is the one for you.
