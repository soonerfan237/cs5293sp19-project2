After his widower father dies in a horsing accident, young XXX Burlinson (as Jim Craig) is left to manage his Australian "Snowy River" farm, with only wizened, peg-legged prospector Kirk Douglas (as Spur) to help. Times are hard, so XXX Burlinson goes to work for XXX Douglas' wealthy, silver-haired brother rancher "XXX Harrison" (also played by Kirk Douglas). When a big job comes up, the silver-haired (older?) Douglas feels XXXXXXXXX is too young and inexperienced to go along; so, XXXXXXXXX stays behind, and falls in love with the boss' daughter, Sigrid Thornton (as Jessica Harrison).<br /><br />The least satisfactory aspect of director George Miller's "The Man from Snowy River" is a weak storyline. Observe, for example, the "XXXXXXX is lost" sequence of events. The damsel gets lost in one of those "freak" storms, while running away. Her worried father rounds up a posses of drunk men to find her, after predicting bad weather. Damsel "XXXXXXX" rolls herself on to the edge of a conveniently appearing cliff. Father and the suddenly sober men don't check XXXXXXXXX's farm. XXXX Burlinson discovers the damsel. After building a fire, he decides to kiss her.<br /><br />The "romance" is played too innocently for as obvious an attracted man and woman as XXXXXXXXX and Ms. Thornton. To make matters worse, the Douglas brothers have a "dark history" which is revealed before any mystery is built up regarding the matter. The main attraction, herein, is the Australian scenery.<br /><br />**** The Man from XXXXX River (1982) George Miller ~ Tom Burlinson, Kirk Douglas, Sigrid Thornton
