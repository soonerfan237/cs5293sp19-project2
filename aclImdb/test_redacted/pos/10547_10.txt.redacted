I love this film, it is excellent and so funny, XXX is FIT and i wouldn't mind meeting him on holiday!! I rate this film a 10 because its gr8 and i hope they never re make it because it would never be the same. Funny bit is wen XXXXX is looking at the moon,and he shouts at Nicole to 'come outside and look at the moon' that bit always makes me laugh and never gets old. Another thing is XXXXXX looks a lot older then 14... but shes a gr8 actress. But i need help with something Does n e 1 no the name of the song played at the end wen XXXXXX and Andre are dancing??? Its really bugging me because i want 2 no what it is because its a nice song!!
