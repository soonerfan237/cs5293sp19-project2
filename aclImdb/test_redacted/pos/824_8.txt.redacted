I have not seen a Van Damme flick for a while, pleasantly surprised, he still has it, looking older, but tougher, kind of like XXX, becomes more rugged with age. This is a good flick and has prompted me to take a look at all the Van Damme movies I have missed over the last ten years. I would like to see a good director put XXX Damme on the big screen with a good plot. XXX Damme still has the moves to amaze the audiences, the last movie viewed with XXX Damme was Legionnaire, that was a good flick as well. In addition, I looked in to XXX Damme's early fighting history, I too my amazement I realized he is the real deal, very accomplished martial artist in his younger years.
