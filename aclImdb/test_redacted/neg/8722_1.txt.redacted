What can I say? After having read XXXXXXX's books and loving Lynch's movie version, I was extremely disappointed. I felt I was watching a reject version of XXXX Rogers. The sets looked like left overs from a Star Wars TV special! I felt the acting was a bit amateurish by most. The costumes were garish and over done which gave it a '60s XXXXX Gordon, pulp feel. The worms! They're supposed to be XXXX Worms and yet they appeared to "big stalagtites" with a mouth at the blunt end. The effects in general were pretty second rate. I won't even start about the disgraceful "Navigator" effect.<br /><br />This so-called "XXXXX Herbert's Dune" wasn't even faithfull to his books! It should have been called "XXXXX Herbert's Dune - For Dummies". Key plot elements were left out, names were changed and the entire "feel" of the story was "sanitised". I didn't even recognise the Harkonnens! In fact most of the characters appeared nothing like XXXXXXX's descriptions had depicted them. I'm starting to get upset just remembering what a tragedy it was. I'm glad I couldn't stomach the second installment....
