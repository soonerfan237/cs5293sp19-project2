"Crossfire" is a justifiably famous 1947 noir that's a murder mystery with a strong message. It stars XXXXXX XXXXX, XXXXXX XXXXXXX, XXXXXX XXXX, XXX XXXXXX, and XXXXXX XXXXXXX, and is strongly directed by XXXXXX XXXXXXX. We witness the murder in shadow at the beginning, and for the rest of the film, XXXXX, as the detective, Finlay, in charge of the case, seeks to figure out which of three soldiers is responsible for the death, and just as important, why. The victim, XXXXXX XXXXXXX (XXX XXXXXX) is someone the soldiers meet in a bar; they go up to his apartment to continue their visit, and XXXXXXX winds up dead.<br /><br />I don't know about 1947, but seeing "Crossfire" today, one knows who did it and why the minute we see the suspects. I don't suppose it was so apparent back then, as these actors were just getting started. Nevertheless, the film packs a big punch with its powerful acting, good direction, violence, and unsparing anti-Semite language.<br /><br />The characterizations are vivid, including that of XXXXXX XXXXXXX in a smallish role - she's a woman who meets Mitchell (XXXXXX XXXXXX), one of the suspect soldiers, in a bar and can provide him with an alibi. The big performance in the film belongs to XXXXXX XXXX, but everyone is excellent. XXXXXX XXXXX especially is effective as a tough but intelligent police detective. Mitchum is very likable as a soldier trying to help his confused friend Mitchell, a lonely man unsure if he still has feelings for his wife.<br /><br />Truly excellent, and a must see.
