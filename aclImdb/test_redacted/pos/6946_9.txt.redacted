Even a decade after "Frontline" aired on the ABC, near as I can tell, "current affairs" programmes are still using the same tricks over and over. Time after time, "Today XXXXXXX" and "A Current Affair" are seen to be hiding behind the facade of journalistic professionalism, and yet they feed us nothing but tired stories about weight-loss and dodgy tradesmen, shameless network promotions and pointless celebrity puff-pieces. Having often been subjected to that entertainment-less void between 'The XXXXXXXX' at 6:00 PM and 'Sale of the Century' (or 'Temptation') at 7:00 PM, I was all too aware of the little tricks that these shows would use to attract ratings.<br /><br />Fortunately, four rising comedians  XXX XXXXX, XXXX XXXXXXX, XXXXX XXXXXXX and XXX XXXXXXXX  were also all too aware of all this, and they crafted their frustrations into one of the most wickedly-hilarious media satires you'll ever see on television. The four entertainers had already met with comedic success, their previous most memorable television stint being on 'The Late Show,' the brilliant Saturday night variety show which ran for two seasons from 1992-1993, and also featured fellow comedians XXXX XXXXXX, XXXX XXXXXX, XXXXX XXXXXXXX and XXXXXX Lucy.<br /><br />"Frontline" boasts an ensemble of colourful characters, each with their own distinct and quirky personality. The current-affairs show is headed by nicely-groomed XXXX XXXXX (XXX XXXXX), an ambitious, pretentious, dim-witted narcissist. XXXX works under the delusion that the show is serving a vital role for society  he is always adamant that they "maintain their journalistic integrity"  and his executive producers have excelled into getting him to believe just that. XXXX is basically a puppet to bring the news to the people; occasionally he gets the inkling that he is being led along by the nose, but usually this thought is stamped out via appeals to his vanity or promises of a promotion.<br /><br />XXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX (XXXX XXXXXXX) is the senior female reporter on the show. She is constantly concerned about her looks and public profile, and, if the rumours are to be believed, she has had a romantic liaison with just about every male celebrity in existence. Another equally amoral reporter, XXXXX XX XXXXXX, is portrayed by XXXXXX XXXX, who memorably played inept solicitor XXXXXX XXXXXX in the Australian comedy classic, 'The Castle.' XXXX Ward (XXXXXX XXXXX) is the Line Producer on the show, and the single shining beacon of morality on the "Frontline" set. Then there's the highly-amusing weatherman, XXXXXXXX XXXXXX (XXXXX XXXXXXX), XXXX's best friend and confidant. Geoff makes a living out of always agreeing with XXXX's opinion, and of laughing uproariously at his jokes before admitting that he doesn't get them.<br /><br />For each of the shows three seasons, we are treated to a different EP, XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX. Brian Thompson (XXXXX XXXXXXXX), who unfortunately passed away in 1995, runs the programme during Season 1. He has a decent set of morals, and is always civil to his employees, and yet is more-than-willing to cast these aside in favour of high ratings. XXX Murphy (XXXXX XX XXXXXX) arrives on set in Season 2, a hard-nosed, smooth-talking producer who knows exactly how to string XXXX along; the last episode of the second season, when XXXX finally gets the better of him, is a classic moment. Graeme "Prowsey" Prowse (XXXXX XXXXXX), EP for the third season, is crude, unpleasant and unashamedly sexist. It's, therefore, remarkable that you eventually come to like him.<br /><br />With its cast of distinctive, exaggerated characters, "Frontline" has a lot of fun satirising current-affairs programmes and their dubious methods for winning ratings. Many of the episodes were shot quickly and cheaply, often implementing many plot ideas from recent real-life situations, but this never really detracts from the show's topicality ten years on. Celebrity cameos come in abundance, with some of the most memorable appearances including XXXXXXX XXXXXX, XXX XXXXX and XXX XXXXXXX. Watch out for XXXXX XXXXXXX's hilarious appearance in the Season 2 episode "Changing the Face of Current Affairs," playing XXXXX XXXXXX, an American hired by the network to reform the show.<br /><br />Particularly in the third season, I noticed that "Frontline" boasted an extremely gritty form of black humour, uncharacteristic for such a light-hearted comedy show. Genuinely funny moments are born from Brooke being surreptitiously bribed into having an abortion, murder by a crazed gunman and XXXX treacherously betraying his best friend's hopes and dreams, only to be told that he is a good friend. The series' final minute  minus an added-scene during the credits, which was probably added just in case a fourth season was to be produced  was probably the greatest, blackest ending to a comedy series that I've yet seen.<br /><br />Below is listed a very tentative list of my top five favourite "Frontline" episodes, but, make no mistake, every single half-hour is absolutely hilarious and hard-hitting satire.<br /><br />1) "The Siege" (Season 1)<br /><br />2) "Give 'em Enough Rope" (Season 2)<br /><br />3) "Addicted to Fame" (Season 3)<br /><br />4) "Basic Instincts" (Season 2)<br /><br />5) "XXX XXX and Stir" (Season 1)
