I guess this is the first time I have seen a Roscoe 'XXXXX' XXXXXXXX movie. I really liked him in his (title) role as a butcher boy. The way he moves is very funny in my opinion, for example how he handles his knife and the way he rolls a cigarette. I think he is a good actor; his facial expressions really suit the role he plays, for example how he winks at the audience in the end. But one might add that that was probably not too difficult. Anyway I think he would have deserved a longer career. As you probably know it was ruined by greedy journalists who made money by printing false accusations that said he was involved in a scandal.<br /><br />The plot is not very important. In the first half, XXXXX and XXXX are employees at a store and rivals for XXXXXXXXX's affection. After a heavy food fight, XXXXXXXXX is sent to a girls' school by her father, the store owner. (This is the beginning of the second half). Both XXXXX and XXXX enter the school in drag, and the fight for XXXXXXXXX continues. (Some of the characters' names are different in the version that I have seen. It seems that for some reason they replaced the original title cards with new ones.)<br /><br />There are a lot of corny gags like food fights and pratfalls, but they are done well in my opinion. And there are some gags I really liked, for example how they make the dog run the pepper mill (or is it a coffee mill?), or the scene when XXXXX dons a coat although it is obviously not necessary, or when XXXX XXXXXXX, the head of the girls' school, spanks XXXXX, and he spanks her back.<br /><br />XXXXXX XXXXXX is also funny in this, his first, movie; a good addition to the cast. In the first half he is a customer at the store, in the second half he supports XXXX in his fight for XXXXXXXXX. I liked his acrobatics, for example when XXXXX pushes him from one room of the school to another, he doesn't show a simple pratfall but lands on his hands and his head and does a little pirouette. Watch out for one scene in the food fight: XXXX throws a flour bag at him, but it misses and hits the store owner instead. That makes XXXXXX laugh, which must be a rarity since he normally always shows a neutral expression (which - as you probably also know already - got him the nickname 'The XXXXX XXXXX XXXX'). (One more note: XX XXX XXXX, who plays XXXX, was 'XXXXX' XXXXXXXX's nephew, and later became famous for the role of 'Fuzzy' that he played in lots of westerns.)<br /><br />I don't like this one as much as I like, for example, 'One XXXX' and 'The Balloonatic' (films that XXXXXX made later, without 'XXXXX'). And it didn't make me laugh out loud often - but it made me smile a lot, so I have given it eight points.
