"The Long Kiss Goodnight" is an enjoyable and very cool action thriller, and a career breakthrough for XXXXX Davis. The plot is very familiar to that of The Bourne Identity but so what. The fight scenes are a real treat for the eyes and the plotline is strong enough to keep you engaged for the 2 hours.<br /><br />It's directed with a slick sense of style and avoids most action cliches. XXXXX Davis is great as an action chick and gets past her usual "good wife" role. XXXXXX L. Jackson is good as usual as the supporting player. The film's baddie is overly cheesy though and you can tell what's going to happen to him. <br /><br />It breaks away from the usual run-of-the-mill actioners such as Commando and On XXXXXX Ground and is definetly one of the best actioners in years. Good fun and good popcorn entertainment. 7.4/10.
