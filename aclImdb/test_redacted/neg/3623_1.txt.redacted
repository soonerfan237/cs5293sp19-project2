This is a children's TV series about a Mary-Sue who is at the same time, mean and bitchy. I couldn't bring my self to sit through 3 episodes of Zoey101. Not to mention that XXXXX Lynn Spears can't act to save her life! What message does this show bring to kids? If you're not perfect like XXXX, you're unworthy *rollseyes*.<br /><br />It's absurd how XXXX's character is exactly the type of person who would be despised in real life yet she manages to become so popular. Then there is Chase who is basically a lovesick puppy who worships the ground Zoey walks on. Then there is the fact that all the other characters seem to have been dumbed down in order to stop them from outshining XXXX. I'm sorry but the characterization in this show = extremely unrealistic.
