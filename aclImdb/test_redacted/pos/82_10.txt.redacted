When the circus comes to town and places the lion's cage directly over XXXX Bunny's home, XXXX ends up somewhere in the range right between freaked out and intrepid. Despite the title "XXXXXXXXX Bunny", it's only at the end when Bugs and the lion perform acrobatics. But even leading up to that, it's quite funny what XXXX does to escape getting eaten; somehow, he always manages to use the other character's weakness against him, and then pull any convenient object out of thin air! Bugs later ended up in the circus in "Big Top Bunny". I liked this one better, as the latter got drug down a little bit by giving the antagonist an Eastern European accent (I know that it was during the Cold War, but still). I recommend this one.<br /><br />And with the end, we can affirm that it'll never be XXXXX Oe for this cartoon.
