Admittedly, I am not a fan of the Monogram Chan films. . The plot, involving radium theft from a bank vault, is a bit far fetched and a long way from the atmospheric mysteries that XXX produced. Mantan Moreland and XXXXXX Fong (as No. 3 XXX Tommy) provide some laughs as usual. But otherwise there isn't much here. Great title that is wasted.
