My mother is as XXXX With The Wind as one can be. She has the collector's plates, the XXXXX and XXXXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXXXXX dolls, GWTW Christmas ornaments, even a GWTW cookbook! My sister and I had only seen bits and pieces of GWTW but we knew the whole plot by heart. On a whim, my sister bought this miniseries thinking my mother would like it and we had taken an interest in it after leafing through the novel a bit.<br /><br />Yesterday we decided to watch both XXXX With The Wind and XXXXXXXX. We started GWTW at about 2:30 in the afternoon and ended it at 6:30. We started XXXXXXXX right after. My mother usually goes to bed at about 10:00, she wound up staying up until 1:30 with us to finish it! We were riveted! I like how the movie starts off at Melanie's funeral, right where XXXXXXXX left off saying, "I'll think about it tomorrow." XXXXXXXX doesn't stay in Georgia for long, she runs off to Charleston in her quest to win him back. XXXXX is not happy when he finds XXXXXXXX in his home so he leaves for the family's plantation. XXXXXXXX, being XXXXXXXX, follows him and they finally agree to put aside their quarrels for a time in order to keep the gossip at bay. XXXXX starts to enjoy her company again and takes her out on his boat. A storm comes up and they sink. He helps her swim to the shore of some island. Terrified that she has died, XXXXX is anxious until she awakes. When she does they both get swept up in the moment and make love. XXXXXXXX wakes up the next day back in Charleston but XXXXX has gone and writes that he thinks it best if they never see each other again.<br /><br />XXXXXXXX is heartbroken and when she is so she does some stupid things, in this case she is seen by XXXX XXXXXXX going up into a hotel room alone with XXXXXX. Nothing happens, but her reputation is stained so XXXXXXXX goes to Savannah with her two spinster aunts. She soon discovers that she is pregnant and decides to wait for the right time to tell XXXXX. While in Savannah she meets many of her O'Hara relatives and grows to like one cousin in particular a Father XXXXX. She soon gets her divorce notice from XXXXX and then decides she will never tell him about her baby just to spite him. XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX.<br /><br />She decides to go to Ireland to make sure XXXXX can never discover her condition. She meets many more relatives and buys a beautiful ancestral home XXXXXXXXX. Through out this time, XXXXX is courting XXXX. It is on Halloween when XXXXXXXX gets the notice that XXXXX has remarried, she goes into labor that night.<br /><br />The movie skips to a year later and XXXXXXXX is very happy with her beautiful daughter XXX. She is being pursued by XXXX XXXXXXX XXXXXX who is really an evil man, forcing a young girl named XXXX XXXXX to sleep with him. XXXXXXXX meets XXXXX and XXXX again at a horse fair. After a riding accident, XXXXXXXX has a conversation with XXXX and learns that she and XXXXX are to have a baby. Heartbroken again, XXXXXXXX leaves and goes to Dublin with XXXXXX. There she cultivates a relationship with him, like I said, she does stupid things when she is heartbroken.<br /><br />XXXX XXXXX has discovered she is pregnant and goes to XXXXX for help. The priest urges XXXXXX to help the girl and XXXXXX murders him after XXXXX threatens to tell XXXXXXXX. XXXXXX convinces XXXXXXXX to go to London with him to escape her grief over XXXXX's death. XXXX asks to go with her. Back in Charleston, XXXX has died of XXXXXX XXXXX. It is made clear that she never bore XXXXX a child.<br /><br />In London, XXXXXXXX sees XXXXXX's true colors after he hurts her when she isn't in the mood the sleep with him. XXXXXX rapes her after she tells him she never wants to see him again. She falls unconscious after and when she wakes up XXXXXX has been stabbed to death. XXXXXXXX is charged with his murder.<br /><br />XXXXX hears about it and rushes off to England with XXXXX in tow. Fearful of the gallows, XXXXXXXX has no choice but to tell XXXXX about their daughter. XXXXX is furious at her for keeping such a secret but stays to help her. XXXX XXXXX, the real killer, can't be found. XXXXXXXX is found guilty but XXXX finally arrives to declare her innocence. After promising to help XXXX, XXXXXXXX leaves with XXXXX for Ireland because as he says, "It's time I became acquainted with my daughter." The scene where he sees XXX for the first time is absolutely beautiful. In Ireland, XXXXX sees how much XXXXXXXX has changed and the two finally reconcile completely and admit they still love each other deeply.<br /><br />After seeing GWTW, I will say that yes, XXXXXX XXXXX was a better XXXXXXXX, but I liked the character of XXXXXXXX in this film than in the first. The reason being that in GWTW, you don't know why you like XXXXXXXX. She's so cruel to XXXXX and haughty and spoiled, but you like her lively spirit. In XXXXXXXX, you see how much she has changed. Oh she is still in the lap of luxury, but she's not haughty anymore. You see how she becomes a true mother to XXX and a generous person to the poor people of Ireland. XXXXXX XXXXXXX does and excellent job at playing this new side of XXXXXXXX. XXXXXXX XXXXXX is not XXXXX XXXXX, but at times you swear that you can see original XXXXX in him.<br /><br />If you just sit back and not compare XXXXXX XXXXXXX and XXXXXXX XXXXXX with XXXXXX XXXXX and XXXXX XXXXX, you will most certainly enjoy this movie. It's a chance to compare the XXXXXXXX of yesterday, the one she becomes after "tomorrow".
