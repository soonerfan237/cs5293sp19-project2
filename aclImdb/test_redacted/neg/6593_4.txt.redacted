This is based on XXXXXXX's life from 1983/4 till 2004. XXXX Alexander did a good performance but looked nothing like Michael. I feel XXXXXXX was portrayed as a stupid person which I don't believe he was (even though he trusted the wrong people at times). I thought XXXX Alexander looked Chinese when they made Michael look white. I think XXXXXX should of been portrayed in this, she was always pictured with her brother in the 80's. I never thought any of the supporting cast looked like their counterparts. There were some things that were inaccurate XXXX-Marie Presley's son looked about 4 in the wedding scene even though he was not yet 2 when XXXX and Michael got married. Also when XXXXXXX says to his mother Katherine he thinks he and Debbie should marry if she is carrying his child, it was Katherine's idea for the two to get married.
