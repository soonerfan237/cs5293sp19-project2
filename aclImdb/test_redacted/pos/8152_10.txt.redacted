For an independent film it scores well with reasonably high production values and a great cast. The acting is uneven but the plot is compelling. We could have used a bit more development of XXX XXXXXX's character, but hey, the guy's fun to look at nonetheless! XXXX Kay Place and XXXXXXXXXX XXXXXX are like icing on the cake.<br /><br />It's not surprising that it was controversial on its release. It presents a less than flattering portrayal of the Morman Church and its relationship with gays. While, like XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX, it's about tolerance and accepting one's own life, I found it to be more successful in conveying a positive message. It was more moving, too.
