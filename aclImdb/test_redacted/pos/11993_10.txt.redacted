One of the most interesting things is that this 1988 film is highly touted as an `in-name only' sequel. There's nothing wrong with that except this: The return of XXXXX XXXXX as XX XXXX. This connects the viewer to this character (from the original Caddyshack in 1980,) and makes fans thinking or wanting XXXXXXXXXX XX to be similar to the first one.<br /><br />There are rumors that XXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX was supposed to return. He carried a big part of the first film, so his return would have put Caddyshack 2 over the top. XXXXXX XXXXX is the `new' Rodney for this movie and does a decent job, even though their comic deliveries are way different. XXX XXXXXXX was great but not in the film enough. He should have been involved to the tune of how much screen time XXXX XXXXXX got in the first one. XXXXXX Stack (Airplane!) was good in the `new' XXX Knight/Villian role. (We miss you, XXX!) XXXny XXXXXX should have been back. So many others could have returned to show us what happened to their characters eight years later. Bushwood should not have undergone the total makeover it did. Instead, the characters involved, rather than the club itself, should have been the main focus like they were in the first one. When you watch this film, keep in mind that it isn't a major sequel and you may think it's another good or bad eighties comedy. Fans of the first should see it but don't be shocked when the comparisons between the original and XXXX XX are so far apart.
