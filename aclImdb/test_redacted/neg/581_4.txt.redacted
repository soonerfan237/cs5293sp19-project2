"May contain spoilers" Sadly XXX Costellos' last film has the distinction of being slightly better than Abbott & Costello's last movie together "Dance With Me Henry". This movie isn't all in all outright terrible it is an amusing career misfire. XXXXXXX Provine is nice to look at and makes the movie somewhat bearable. You can't blame XXX Costello for this because a major studio released it which meant somebody had to give it the "green" light. In my opinion XXX Costello was getting over problems of his own losing his son a few years earlier and the unwarranted attacks from the IRS. If you look at the last 3-4 Abbott & Costello movies you can notice the magic was gone. Check out "Dance With XX Henry" now that's a painful movie to watch.
