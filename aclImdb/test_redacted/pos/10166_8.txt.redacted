"The Man XXX XXXX XXX Much" (1955) is XXXXXX XXXXXXXXX's own remake of his 1934 thriller about a married couple (XXXXX XXXXXXX and XXXXX Day) on vacation in Morocco where they got caught up in a nightmare that include murder, espionage, assassinations and the worst of all, kidnapping of their 10-years-old son. The movie which XXXXXXXXX himself considered superior to the original is a great fun. XXXXXXX and Day have a good chemistry together. The film is filled with the wonderful comical scenes and dialogues as well as the scenes of chilling suspense. <br /><br />The inclusion of "Que Sera, Sera" proved to be a stroke of genius because rarely the song fits the content and plays such an important role in the movie like "Que Sera, Sera" did in "The Man XXX XXXX XXX Much". <br /><br />XXXXXXXXX also treats us to the live music playing from XXXXXX XXXXXXXX "XXXXX XXXXX XXXXXXX" for almost ten minutes while scene in London's Royal XXXXXX XXXX where the assassination of a very important politician was attempted takes place and both, the scene and the cantata are simply marvelous.
