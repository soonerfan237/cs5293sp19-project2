I must admit, I liked this movie, and didnt find it all misogynist. It could be subtitled, three ways of looking at LiV Tyler. Three different men become obsessed with the same woman,and tell their stories to very different characters;One man(XXXX XXXXXXX) tells his story to a priest(the very funny XXXXXXX XXXXXXX).For Goodmans charcter, the Liv Tyler character is an idealized saint, the second coming of his sainted wife,Theresa.For XXXX XXXXXXX character(who tellls story to a shrink(a fine, understated performance by the great XXXX XXXXXXXX),the Liv Tyler character is simplyan object of (kinky)sexual fantasy.Finally XXXX XXXXXXX rather dimwitted charcter tells HIS side of the story to a sleazy hit man, played by XXXXXXX Douglas.All three of these narratives of obsession are told simultaneously,and all are amusing. Finaly the film ends in a bizarrely funny climax, that I wont give away.
