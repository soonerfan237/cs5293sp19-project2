I went to see this movie mostly because it looked so good in the trailers. XXXXX Williams and Barry Levinson should equal greatness. Instead it just continues XXXXXXXX' bad streak of movies lately. What's wrong with the movie? More like what's right: the ensemble crew does a pretty good job around XXXXX, and like usual, Christopher Walken is fantastic. That being said, this movie just plain wasn't good. I really only recommend seeing it if you want to see what it would be like if XXX Stewart ran for president and won. Saying he won isn't a spoiler, since it was in the trailer. The concept and idea is really amusing, but that's all. Most of XXXXX's jokes are just recycled from old comedy bits of his, and there are very few laugh out loud moments, and most are just dumb. Like most comedies that turn out to suck, all of the funny bits are put into the trailer. Really no surprises there, but come on! Some of the movie reads like a Tom Clancy or XXXXX Flynn novel! People were expecting this to be XXXXX's return to greatness. Instead, it's more a Flubber.
