Fun movie! The script is awful but the quality of actors saves the day. XXXX Hurt is perfect, as is XXXX XXXXXXXXX. XXXX Bridges is fair and the actress who plays his wife is very weak. The story is the true star. Based on a true story, the pace moves well and the whole concept of escaping XXXX XXXXXXX sucks you in and holds you. Joyous ending provides enough elation to compensate for script. Don't expect XXXXXXX XXXXX quality but it's a great ride for the whole family.
