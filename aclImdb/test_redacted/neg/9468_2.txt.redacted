A couple of clarifying comments are in order. XXXXXXXXX Gordon Lewis contributed a brief introduction to the video release of DOCTOR GORE (aka THE BODY SHOP), wherein he touched upon his collaborative efforts with J.G. "Pat" XXXXXXXXX, director and star of DOCTOR GORE. XXXXXXXXX concocted the "gore effects" for THE GRUESOME TWOSOME and a few other Lewis movies in the late 60s. XXXXX remarks that whereas 2,000 MANIACS was a "five gallon" film (referring to the amount of stage blood required), the XXXXX-Patterson productions were "fifteen gallon" pictures. XXXXX does not describe DOCTOR GORE as a "fifteen gallon" film -- he's only talking about the films he & Patterson made together. XXXXX has confessed (elsewhere) that his introduction to DOCTOR GORE was improvised before he'd even seen Patterson's film! So take it with a grain of salt. <br /><br />This may be an "unfinished" film, but like some unfinished novels it does have an "ending." It's just missing some connective tissue. <br /><br />XXXXXXXXX has definite stage presence & a dry sense of humor, helping to make this simplistic show somewhat more watchable than it should be. There's an extremely bare-bones plot -- even BLOOD FEAST is more complex -- and a gratingly repetitive musical score by XXXXXXX Girdler. A bit of nudity & lots of skin. The entire middle section of the film involves the construction of a "perfect woman;" this is concentrated gore for the bloodthirsty, and laughable. <br /><br />Patterson the director is in way over his head, but he tries hard to tell his story creatively, if it's possible to use Frankenstein clich√©s creatively. But the best reason to see this film (on Something XXXXX's DVD, if possible) is that it features a perfect Nashville weeper, Bill Hicks' "A Heart Dies Every Minute." Ain't it the truth!
