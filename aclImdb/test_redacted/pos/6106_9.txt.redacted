XXXXXXXX XXXXX stars as the principal figure in this story; as I watched it, I remembered her bit part in Adrian Lynes's "Ünfaithful" as XXXXX XXXX's neighbor in a tony NY neighborhood.<br /><br />This movie was surprisingly good, and XXXXX XXXXXXXX deserves credit for an accurate portrayal of class, crimes, and misdemeanors, which actually occur in upscale neighborhoods (perish the thought!!!).It is real but not over-dramatized; the audience lives through her accident, the pain it has caused;denial; and the ultimate resolution.<br /><br />It is more than just a question of "what is a good person" as XXXXX speaks to her husband....is a person's character defined by one single act; and should they be condemned forever because of their action?? The questions are pertinent; It is also amusing to see several cinematic references to XXXXXX XXXXXXX (i.e. the fussy, bothersome mother);XXXXX is reputed by her sometime friends to be a "perfect hostess, with perfect genes"....(gag); and a scene wherein XXXXX is confronted by police;(the "friends" also betray her, later)....<br /><br />The denial and facades of American society are addressed; (Oh, murder doesn't occur here; similar to the theme in "Ä Season in Purgatory", by author XXXXXXXX XXXXX, about the true murder of XXXXXX XXXXXX; in Greenwich, Connecticut); XXXXX is aware of her crime; but consciously finds herself perpetuating the facade, until she finally breaks down;rent or buy this film; she is an underrated actress who does quite well in these roles.
