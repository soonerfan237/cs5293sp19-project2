XXXXXX is excellent as the brash cadet who thinks West Point will really amount to something now that he has arrived. XXXXXX displays his easy, goofy comic persona as he takes on West Point and XXXX XXXXXXXX, the local beauty. Great fun for the first half. And amazingly touching after XXXXXX's character goes too far and nearly gets shunned by fellow cadets. The new, humility-filled XXXXXX get s alast-minute reprieve to play in the bill football game against XXXX and, despite a broken arm, wins the game. Great, rousing entertainment by MGM in this XXXXXX formula film, shows XXXXX at his best. XXXXXXX Bakewell also scores as the skinny follower. The handsome-but-goony character would be played by XXXXX XXXXX, XXXX XXXXX, XXXX XXXXXX and others in later decades, another take on the beautiful-but-daffy dames played by XXXXXX XXXXXXX and XXXXXX XXXXXX. West Point is a winner!
