XXXXX, written and directed by XXXXX XXXXXXXX, is a little tale that speaks of respect for the ocean, respect for humans young and old, and respect for cultural differences. It is a new tale of a little goldfish wishing to be a girl, rather than a retelling of Disney's Little Mermaid. XXXXXXXX has animated by hand, a whimsical, magical film for the young and the young-at- heart. The film begins with a slow undulating blue-green palette of sea anemones, jellyfish, and scores of little fanciful goldfish with childlike faces. There isn't any need for narrative, the motion of the creatures and the music of Jo Hisaiahi tell the beginning. Released last summer in Japan, XXXXX won the Japanese Academy's award for XXXX XXXXXXXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXXX (Jezebel.com). The fanciful little goldfish, Brunhild, leaves her ocean home on a jellyfish. Upon reaching the surface she is caught up in a fishing net full of other fish, garbage, and sludge. She is propelled into a jar, which is rolled to shore where five-year-old XXXXXX (voice by XXXXXXX XXXXX) retrieves it. He cuts his hand when breaking the jar open to free the little goldfish. Brunhild tastes his blood, which heals XXXXXX's cut, and puts in motion her transformation to a human, at the same time throwing nature out of balance. XXXXXX puts the little goldfish in a green pail and names her XXXXX (Noah Cyrus), meaning soft and jelly like. XXXXXX's mother, XXXX (Tina Fey), lets him take XXXXX to school, which is right next door to the nursing home where she works. XXXX's crazy driving down the picturesque winding road, past a dry dock, through the bustling fishing town, and up a tree-lined road to the nursing home is representative of XXXXXXXX's wonderful sequence of action and illustrates perfectly a parent's hectic morning. XXXXXXXX has created another strong, independent, female character in XXXX. Making her a loving, sensible, modern mother both to XXXXXX and XXXXX. XXXX's telephone conversation with the not-coming-home-again husband, XXXXXX (XXXX XXXXX) because the ship he captains must make another run, is a typical wife's reaction. Later that evening XXXXXX intercedes using a signal lamp to speak to his father as the ship passes the cliff their house sits on. XXXX refuses to acknowledge XXXXXX's apology and jumps up and signals "Bug-off, Bug-off, Bug-off," it is a hilarious scene. But, when XXXXXX takes the signal lamp and tells his dad "Good XXXX, Love You," XXXX hugs him and tells him he has a good heart, it is a very poignant scene.<br /><br />My personal favorites are XXXXXXXX's elderly, granny-type women in wheelchairs at the nursing home, Yochi (XXXXX XXXXX), Noriko (XXXXXX XXXXXXXX) and Toki (Lily Tomlin). Their interchange over XXXXXX's little goldfish is wonderful and reminiscent of the bickering between the Witch of the Waste (XXXXXX XXXXXX) and Sophie (Jean Simmons) as they trudge up a long flight of stairs in XXXX's Moving Castle. XXXXX's magical sea-god father, XXXXXXXX (XXXX XXXXXX) resembling the wizard XXXX arrives to take XXXXX back to her ocean home. XXXXXXXX uses one of his elixirs to try and put nature back in balance, but magical little XXXXX escapes again upsetting more elixir in the process, and causing a tsunami. Running on the backs of giant dolphins to get to XXXXXX, this redheaded, little girl reminds the audience of the stubborn, adventurous little XXX in My Neighbor Totoro. XXXXX is just as adventurous and curious as XXX. When XXXXXXXX realizes what XXXXX has done he calls for XXXX XXXXXX (Kate Blanchett), the Goddess of the ocean, to help with the situation. This wise, calming Goddess arrives in a blue flowing garment that never ends. She has a private talk with XXXX discussing the future of the young children, which helps the audience understand XXXXXX and XXXXX's relationship is not that of lovers, but of brother and sister. The life-goes-on quiet simple ending is typical of XXXXXXXX films leaving the audience full of hope.
