When I first saw "Before XXXXX XXXXX", XXXXXX XXXXXX had just been nominated for an XXXXXXX XXXXX. I thought "he's got it!". He didn't. I watched "XXX XXXXXXX" last night. Please give it to him this time... This is an actor. Convincing, touching, emotional, brilliant. XXX also "Los Lunes al Sol" and you will understand what I am talking about. He is an absolute chameleon and I swear it's not only the result of make-up work. This movie is so beautiful, so well done, the characters are so real. Congratulations to XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX (how about a Best Director nomination?). I also have to mention the make-up artists. I can't think of another word but magnificent. I really hope this movie gets the recognition it deserves. As far as I am concerned, it already has...
