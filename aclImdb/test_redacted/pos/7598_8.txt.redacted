After seeing this movie, I came to the realization that XXXX Barrymore is a great actress. This movie wouldn't have been watchable without XXXX. The fact that somebody as attractive as XXXX, could actually gross me out, and she did when she was "Josie Grossie". Her attempts to "transition" as the cool girls called it were hilarious, especially her trying to dance at the night club.<br /><br />We also had SNL favorite, XXXXX Shannon, playing a great part as Anita, Josie's best friend. One of the funniest scenes in the movie was XXXXX trying to teach the class sex ed. This was one of Mollys funniest performances and best.<br /><br />XXXXXX Sobieski also had a great part and I really felt for her, because I know people like her that got tortured like that.<br /><br />This movie is a must see for Drew Barrymore fans, because Drew makes the movie.
