Created in 1928, and originally named Mortimer before XXXX XXXXXX changed his name (because his wife convinced him), XXXXXX XXXXX has become the staple of the Disney brand. I always thought this cartoon was the first ever cartoon to feature XXXXXX, it is in fact his third, but it doesn't matter, for a six minute animated short it is enjoyable. The story sees XXXXXX piloting a steamboat until XXXXXXX XXXX takes him off the bridge, stopping to pick up cargo, and XXXXXX XXXXX missing the boat. Being lifted on she drops her music sheets and a goat eats them, XXXXXX helps her crank it's tail and play the tune, and getting some other animals to be percussion, until XXXX comes along again to stop him, making XXXXXX peel potatoes. XXXXXX XXXXX was number 53 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 31 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Very good!
