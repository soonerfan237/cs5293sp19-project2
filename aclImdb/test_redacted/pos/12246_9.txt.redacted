Movie watchers often say great movies must have 3 memorable<br /><br />scenes to be considered truly great. Broadcast news doesn't have<br /><br />three, it has twice that. This movie is extremely well written by<br /><br />XXXXX Brooks. Holly XXXXXX and Albert Brooks have never been<br /><br />better. I love this movie for many reasons. It is great because it<br /><br />makes you laugh and it makes you cry. XXXXXX Brooks has several<br /><br />great lines and many unforgettable scenes: # 1(laughed) "I can<br /><br />sing and read, I am singing while I read," with Midnight Train to<br /><br />Georgia playing in the background. # 2(laughed) Telling the<br /><br />XXXXXXX Hurt character that "You really blew the lid off of nookie,"<br /><br />after watching Hurt's report on date-rape. #3 (Cried) When XXXXX<br /><br />(A. Brooks) finally tells Jayne (Hunter) that he loves her and she<br /><br />can't end up with Hurt's character because he represents<br /><br />everything about journalism Jayne finds dispicable. Finally, #4 (laughed) who can forget the scene where XXXXX<br /><br />anchors the weekend news....hilarious. This movie should have won an Oscar! It has everything I love in<br /><br />movies, great acting, intelligent script, and even a Jack Nicholson<br /><br />cameo!
