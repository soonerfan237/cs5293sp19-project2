This film screened at the American Cinematheque's Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood on April 7, 1999. It was described in the American Cinematheque schedule as follows:<br /><br />"TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY 1951, Warners, 90 min. XXXXX Cochran's an ex-con who's never been with a woman. Ruth XXXXX is a dime-a-dance dame with no use for sappy men. A hotel room, a dirty cop, a gunshot - the perfect jump-off for a fugitives-on-the-run love story. This virtually unknown noir is XXXXX Feist's masterwork, packed with revelatory set-pieces. XXXXXXX was never more vulnerable, Roman never sexier. XXXXXXX GUN CRAZY scripted by Steinbeck - it's that good."<br /><br />I just saw this film, and I agree with every word of the above description.
