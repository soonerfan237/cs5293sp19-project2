XXXXX... Does this man brings one of the goriest and weirdest movies ever made? Answer: yes! XXX in the Brain, also known as XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXX is XXXXX's last masterpiece. Yes it is, no matter what some people will say about it. There are few facts why this movie is one of the best XXXXX's movies.<br /><br />XXXXX make a fun of himself and his movies with this one. Lead roll in this movie is no other then XXXXX himself, who plays... well horror-splatter-gore director, who thinks he is slowly going insane. It's filled with black humor which unlike in the most of the modern horror movies works here. Being XXXXX flick, you need to know it's gory. How much? Well pretty much. I always loved gore in the movies and I never get enough of it, but XXX in the Brain actually stopped my thirst for gore, and believe me, it's a hard to archive. Even the Braindead didn't stop it. CITB is all about gore. Almost every scene revolves about XXXXX, who after being hypnotized by *khmmm* evil psychiatrists is seeing all kinds of horrors for everything that happens to him or everything he sees. Some of the scenes involves him accidentally dropping the whiskey, and instead of that he sees rotten corpse lying on the floor, which starts to spit some ooze from it's wounds. Forget the Beyond or Zombie 2, this IS the goriest XXXXX movie! Now I like how XXXXX manage to apply all those comic parts in the gorefest movie. He is such a brilliant director. Some funny moments and lines happens from time to time, like one where XXXXX says "making gore movies is kind of a sickness" Ending is very good considering that XXXXX (and most of the Italian horror masters) is know for making ending with no sense or many plot holes. If you are fun of the XXXXX, make sure you check it out. If you have a weak stomach, avoid this and repeat "Its only a movie" ps. some of the gore scenes within this movie: Chainsaw dismemberment (full), tongue torn out, eyeballs torn out, maggot infested corpses, zombies, decapitations, face being putted in boiling water, stabs in the shower (to head), throat slit, many parts of the body and organs being toast aside, hammer smashed face...
