I can only agree with many observers that XXXXXXX is one of the most memorable dramas ever made for television. I saw XXXXXXX when it was on TV, and I have just watched it again. I am particularly moved by the haunting original music of XXX Souster, and especially by the dolorous strains of Dmitri Shostakovich's Chamber Symphony in C minor ( the music over the credits and in parts of the film). The music intensifies the desperation of the characters as they pursue their sad fate. The music is powerfully emotional. This arrangement combines two of the movements from the symphony, but I recommend listening to the symphony per se.
