Many people are making fun out of XXXXXX Seagals acting abilities. And I really see why if I remember XXXX Down Below. Well...ok his other films are acceptable (regarding to his acting!). <br /><br />After reading reviews about The Patriot I didn't expect anything from this film. I barely came through XXXX Down Below and I read a lot that The Patriot was even worse. So I was really surprised about this one. In my opinion it is one of his very best movies. If it had have more action sequences and a couple more fighting scenes it would be THE best. I liked the story the directing and the actors. XXXXXXXX Belle was just incredible. She will have a great movie-career in the future. The few action scenes were very well made. And XXXXXX Seagal was very believable in his unusual role.
