Pretty decent for his early work and no Kokaku Kidotai without it, and gets an 2 points extra for the easter eggs. For XXXXXX definitely a rung in the ladder. I am biased as a Shirow fan but this was a big step from XXXXX Pair which was what I knew of him. Violent fun with a porno soundtrack! You cannot help but notice that. I know people appreciate him for Ghost in the Shell..but all of the deep spiritual overtones were dealt with in Appleseed. ESWAT killing terrorists, the struggle for humans to stay viable as bioroids phase them out, and XXXXXX staying thin despite her intake of junk food. Definitely like the characters even the traitor..and I do not know why.
