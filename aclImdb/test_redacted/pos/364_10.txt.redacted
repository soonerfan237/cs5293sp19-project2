This is another one of XXXXXXXXX's highest rated movies and rightfully so. This is a tale of two men who meet on a train and playfully exchange murder fantasies. One of them (XXXXXX XXXXXX) takes it seriously and this leads XXX XXXXXX (XXXXXX XXXXXXX) to trouble with the law. Another fast moving XXXXXXXXX movie with lots of great scenes (the carousel scene and the tennis match are worthy of mentioning). Not a movie to be missed- it is a shame that no one will re-release this on DVD with loads of extras- just a cheap Warner Brothers DVD is all thats out there now.
