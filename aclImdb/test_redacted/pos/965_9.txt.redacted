SPOILER ALERT!!!! This was my son's review of the movie, which he wanted me to post.He wrote this, I swear.<br /><br />With XXXXXXX in the Middle's Frankie Muniz, and Nickelodeon's Amanda Bynes, they get to go to show business. They team up on the actor XXXX Giamatti. He stole XXXXX Shepherd's essay on Big Fat Liar, and makes it in to a movie. Jason (XXXXXXX Muniz) and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) have to go to L.A. to get it back. XXXXX's dad does not believe that he wrote that essay. So every time they see each other XXXXX asks Wolf (Paul Giamatti) to give XXXXX's dad a call because he wants his essay BACK!!!! Wolf does not make the movie but the President of the company makes it. At the end the family and XXXXXX see the movie, Made by Wolf Pictures and based on a real story written by Jason Shepherd.
