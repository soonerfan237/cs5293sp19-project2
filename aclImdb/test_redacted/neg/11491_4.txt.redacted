FREDDY FORSYTH has come up with a storyline which will suit the mood of the West's suspicions about XXXXX's Russia. Forsyth installs a nasty guy as the Ruski president who wants to return the country - not so much to XXXXXX's Communism but more to Hitlerian Fascism. In fact, his Political Manifesto could have come straight out of XXXX Kampf rather than Marx. And, the loon has the latest weapons of biological destruction to achieve the ethnic cleansing pogrom of the Russian Federation. American mercenaries connive with the Russian Prez to realise his fanatical, genocidal dream, but then enter XXXXX Dancing's Pat Swayze...and,yep,things get really down and dirty. He's a former US operative-turned-drifter,XXXXX Monk, who is enlisted by the British Government to see what the Russians are up to. As a corny sidebar, XXXXXX's character who is no Monk (!)has sired a Russian beauty Elena (played by the gorgeous XXXXX Kondova) on his previous missions to the former Commie state. XXXXXXX Swayze does a passable job in setting out to defeat the evil Russians. But young unknown actress XXXXX Kondova steals the flick as his nubile, 18-year-old Russian daughter Elena who helps dad root out the terror threatening her beloved Mother Russia.
