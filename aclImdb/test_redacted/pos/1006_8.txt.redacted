[CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!]<br /><br /> Garfield and his owner XXX Arbuckle were in a rut. They basically had no life at all. All they did was lay around and count the ceiling tiles. XXX even organized his sock drawer according to color and fabric. He needed a life. So he consults a book on the subject that tells him to meet a woman. A singles' bar was a great place to start. Unfortunately, when the music started and XXX hit the dance floor, we see what made disco die: XXX killed it. XXX next tried to pick up girls at the video store. He ended up feeling down in the mouth. Literally. The laundromat was no prize either when XXX and his would-be date get a glimpse of each other's underwear. XXX tried to act all buff at the beach, but soon he angered a real buff guy, which left XXX feeling, once again, down in the mouth. Literally. XXX then tried to pick up girls walking and jogging by. No avail. XXX pulled out a guitar and sings the blues. Unfortunately when he mentioned his cat being fat, a fat man walked up and stomped XXX's guitar. It was hopeless.<br /><br /> Fortunately for XXX, an ad flashed on the TV: an ad for Lorenzo's School for the Personality Impaired. It guaranteed a lifeless person to get a life in a few easy steps. XXX and Garfield attend the class. The building didn't exactly look the same way it did on TV, nor did XXXXXXX act as peppy as he did on TV. XXX sat next to a pretty girl named Mona. So while XXXXXXX taught his lessons of introducing yourself, checking your pulse, and pretending to speak a foreign language, Jon and Mona get to know one another. They leave together, forgetting all about XXXXXXXX. At home, XXX and Mona just sat on the porch and talked. XXXXXXXX was jealous of Mona for fear that she would take Jon away from him. XXXXXXXX envisioned the future: Jon and Mona get married, she moves in, and soon she gives birth to a little Arbuckle who is overjoyed at pulling XXXXXXXX's tale. Back to the present, XXXXXXXX would not stand for it. He tried to get XXX to get rid of Mona, until she started scratching behind his ears. But then XXX learned that Mona was allergic to cats. So that was basically the end of their relationship. But they still saw each other every now and then, and XXXXXXXX was sure to be with them.<br /><br /> Another hilarious XXXXXXXX TV special! This one was made during the run of TV's Garfield and Friends. XXXXXXXX was slimmed down somewhat. SOMEwhat. Since hie early 1980's cartoons. The scenes of XXX trying to pick up chicks is funny, so is the one where the fat guy stomps on XXX's guitar. Good ol' XXXXXXX Music is back as Garfield. XXXX Huge is Jon. XXXXX Welker (The third man of 1,000 voices) is Lorenzo. And June Foray (The woman of 1,000 voices) is XXXX. If you like XXXXXXXX, then I recommend you see XXXXXXXX Gets A Life today!
