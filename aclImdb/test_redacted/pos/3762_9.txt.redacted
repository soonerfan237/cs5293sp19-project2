In the first transformation scene, what is the music? I've heard it was "The Greeks Don't Get No Freeks". Is that right? I really liked that sound. I also liked the "XXXX's Got Nothing to Hide" in the final scenes. Truly a doper movie, but with many laughs and puns, sight gags, and slapstick. XXXXX Woo-Woo's place was reminiscent of some places I have visited myself. XXX Venus has appeared in some other stuff that is truly amazing. She looks much different in the movie we're talking about, but her maturity didn't hurt her a bit. XXXX Blankfield reminds one of Gene Wilder in some ways. XXXX Armstrong was beautiful and maintained her beauty for a long time.
