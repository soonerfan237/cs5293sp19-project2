XXXXX Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing that it's rabbit season. But, you guessed it - it's really duck season. XXXXX Fudd appears: he's the only hunter dumb enough to fall for the gag.<br /><br />He's even dumber than that. When XXXX Bunny strides up to him and asks how the rabbit hunting is going, Elmer admits that he hasn't seen a rabbit yet. This is more than XXXXX can stand. He emerges from his hiding place and immediately points to a rabbit: XXXX Bunny. "Shoot him now!" Daffy screams. "You be quiet," says XXXX. "He doesn't have to shoot you now." XXXXX insists that he does.<br /><br />After XXXXX returns his blasted-off beak to his head, he is doomed to more arguments infected with "pronoun trouble" which all have the same result. Later, XXXX dresses as a sexy woman and flirtingly asks Elmer for a duck dinner. Will Daffy get the last laugh? "Ha, ha, very funny! Ha, ha, ha!"<br /><br />What's funny about this classic cartoon? Bug recoils in fright as Daffy screams in his face. Bugs XXXXX says "Yes?" while dripping with self-satisfaction. XXXXX Duck stands on tiptoes demanding to be shot. XXXXX Fudd whines that he "can't wait any wonger." Daffy sees XXXX in women's clothes and makes that little noise with his tongue. XXXX Stalling plays "You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby" during Bugs's drag act. Daffy demands "sheer honesty" out of Bugs. Stalling plays "Home Sweet Home" at an inappropriately appropriate moment. Daffy tells Bugs he's "desthpicable."<br /><br />In five words: every detail of this film.<br /><br />NOTE: This short is available on "XXXXXX Tunes Golden Collection, Volume One," Disc 1
