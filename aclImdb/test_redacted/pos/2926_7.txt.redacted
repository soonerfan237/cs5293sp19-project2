Although, this episode was offensive to the Tourette Syndrome Association, others thought it was funny, while others thought it was a bad way to start the new season.<br /><br />This episode was funny and just shocking. South Park has made history as being their first episode with the most cuss words, unless you count the movie as an episode.<br /><br />I enjoyed how they made fun of XXXXX XXXXXX and his television show, to Catch a Predator. I didn't like the idea on how they thought XXXXX XXXXXX would do a show on tourettes and let a boy speak out and bash the Jews.<br /><br />One thing I did not like is how South Park thought that people with tourettes syndrome would just blurt out bad language like that. I've seen people on television with XXXXXXXXX syndrome and they do not just blurt out bad words. Unless I am incorrect.
