"Out to Sea" is a fun movie starring that wonderful duo of XXXX Lemmon and Walter Matthau. This film is not quite as funny as their "XXXXXX Old Men" comedies (which it strongly resembles), but there are many laughs throughout. Lemmon and XXXXXXX play a couple of in-laws who take a cruise together. Once they get on the boat, the thing XXXXXX doesn't know is that Matthau has signed them on as dance hosts so they don't have to pay for the cruise. This infuriates XXXXXX who's in no mood to dance. What's worse, XXXXXXX doesn't even know how to dance. Nevertheless, they go along with it and it the process they meet some of their fellow passengers and crew members. Here are the crew members: there's the cruise director XXX Godwyn, played to the hilt by "Star Trek: The Next Generation" veteran Brent Spiner, who acts like an evil dictator. There's two fellow dance hosts, played by "XXXXXX Miller" star Hal Linden and veteran movie musical star Donald O'Connor. There's the ship's owner Mrs. Carruthers, played by "XXXXXX Girl" Rue McClanahan. As for the passengers: there's Vivian, a widow played by XXXXXX De Haven, who falls in love with Lemmon. There's XXX, played by one of my all-time favorite actresses, Dyan Cannon, who falls in love with Matthau. There's XXXXX, Liz's mother, played by veteran stage actress Elaine Stritch. And they meet others as well. All these actors are a pleasure to watch as XXXXXX and Matthau play off of them. It's great to see XXXXXX here, see's beautiful as ever; Stritch is a hoot; Spiner is a funny comic villain who's plays it deadly straight; De Haven is wonderful; Linden, O'Connor, and McClanahan have a good moment or two; and finally, the two main stars, Lemmon and Matthau, are fine as usual. A nice little gem of a comedy.<br /><br />*** (out of four)
