This is a family comedy -- in the very best senses of the term. Uncomplicatedly about faith and family, XXX XXXXX, with the help of everybody's favorite Grandpa, XXXXXX XXXXX, gets divine help in lifting the O'Moyne's above the would-be vengeance schemes of Goldtooth McCarthy (XXXX XXXXXXXX). Pure fun.
