I remember seeing this film when I was 13 years old and I fell in love with it and I was a big fan of the film and the characters I adored. My favorite character was XXXXXX (XXXXX XXXXXXXX), because she made me laugh when she showed no interest in XXXX (XXXXXXX XXX) who really liked her and I was hoping that in the end that they would get together then her boring boyfriend, Ralphie (XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXX)because he ignored her and hung out with his friends. I love the cast and the story. I always love the part when XXXX try to get together with XXXXXX, and I always remember when he chased her around the car. But it was so good. I'll always remember cherish that in my teen years. Now that I am 33 years old and I picked up my copy on DVD and will look forward seeing it.
