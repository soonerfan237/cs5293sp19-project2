Every role, down to the smallest, has been cast and acted with bravado.<br /><br />The extraordinary XXXX Malone never takes a misstep. Her two co-stars are equal to her in this film. XXXX Gosling may be the best actor of his generation. XXXXX Klein gives his best performance to date. This is a thought and conversation provoking film that should be seen by teens and young adults. You'll think and talk about this film for days. Highly recommended.
