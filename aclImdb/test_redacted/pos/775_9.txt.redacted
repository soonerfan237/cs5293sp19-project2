I watched this film on ITV and I enjoyed it a lot. It was very watchable and very funny. XXXXX Walters and Rupert Grint were perfect in their roles. XXXXX Walters gets a special mention since she creates a wonderful diverse interesting character to watch. XXX's character is kinda shy and Stoic but the changes he goes through are wonderfully acted out by Rupert Grint, I would definitely say he has a future in acting after Harry Potter.<br /><br />Laura Linney is quite good in her role as XXX's over protective mother, the only thing they went wrong with is by making her too....Villain-y. XXX's father was also an interesting contrast to his mother, and in the end he is quite honourable too. The only character i wasn't keen on was XXXXXX, she was a bit plain and unnecessary i thought.<br /><br />Overall this is a great comedy drama that is very easy to watch. one of my favourite films of the year easily.
