This movie is silly and very short of being a funny movie. Unhappy 'easterners' are not pleased with being out west; so they hire a drunk wagon master(XXXX Candy)to lead them back east. Sight gags were just not funny enough to carry this one. And XXXXXXX Lewis gets on your nerves very quickly; but then I honestly don't like him at anything he does. XX Lauter is hilarious as the bumbling villain.<br /><br />The movie was dedicated to Candy. He died from a massive heart attack ten days before the movie was completed. A stand in and digital enhancement enabled XXXXX's character to be seen in the final scenes. XXXXX was a very good comedian and gave us some real good knee slapping, belly laughs in his career. This movie was just not the caliber of his best.<br /><br />Also in the film, you will recognize: XXXXXXX Sanderson, Gailard Sartain, Ethan Phillips, Ellen Greene and Rodney A. Grant.
