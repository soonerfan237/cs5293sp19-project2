I first saw this film in 1980 and it touched a cord which reminded me of a more innocent time. The opening narrative, music and paintings by XXXXXX Rockwell set the tone for me. You either love the movie or hate it. XXX Michael Vincent was at his all time best and portrayed Cpl Marion Hedgepeth in a most innocent and touching way. This movie is at the top of my all time favorites, a shame it isn't available on DVD or VHS anymore. The ending was also wonderful. XXXX Hancock did a marvelous job of capturing the essence of the time.
