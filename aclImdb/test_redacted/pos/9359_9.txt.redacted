A March 1947 New York Times article described XXXXXXXXX as one of the first Hollywood films of the 1940s to "face questions of racial and religious prejudice with more forthright courage than audiences have been accustomed to expect." While RKO was producing XXXXXXXXX, Twentieth Century-Fox was making Gentleman's Agreement, another story about antisemitism. RKO raced to beat the much "ballyhooed" XXX picture to the theaters, releasing Crossfire several months before Gentleman's Agreement. In July 1947, RKO screened Crossfire for representatives of various Los Angeles religious groups. In addition, several surveys, which were designed to gauge the audience's prejudices, were conducted before and after screenings of the film. XXXXXXXXX received both praise and criticism for its depiction of antisemitism in America and was the subject of many editorials. XXXXXXXXX received an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture, but lost to Gentleman's Agreement. It was also nominated for XXXX Supporting Actor (Robert Ryan), XXXX Supporting Actress (Gloria Grahame), XXXX Director and XXXX Screenplay (Adaptation). In September 1947, XXXXXXXXX was named Best Social Film at Cannes. In December 1947, XXXXX magazine, an African-American publication, gave the film its annual award for "improving interracial understanding." Loved this movie. If you get the chance to watch it, see it.
