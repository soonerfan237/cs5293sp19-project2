XXXXXXXX Petersen (Das Boot, XXX XXXXX XXX) gives us an exciting film where the accolades go to the supporting actor, XXXX XXXXXXXXX. His criminal attempting to assassinate the President was first-rate and credible.<br /><br />That is not to diminish the efforts of XXXXX XXXXXXXX and XXXX XXXXX, or even XXXX XXXXXX XXXXXXXX, who plays a real jerk of a White House Chief of Staff. Eastwood was great, and I love any film that Russo is in.<br /><br />The movie feature original music by five time XXXXX winner (Mal√®na, XXXXX, The Untouchables, The Mission, XXXX of Heaven) XXXXX XXXXXXXXX. That alone makes it worth your time.
