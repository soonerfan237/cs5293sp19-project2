I actually liked this movie even though this movie seems to be so hated and i think it's even better then The Deer Hunter, which was overrated. Both this movie and Year Of The Dragon are very underrated although i could see why someone would not like this movie. At three and a half hours the movie just goes on too long and the second half of the movie is much better than the first half. XXXX XXXXtofferson and XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXX are fighting over XXXXXXXX XXXXXXX but she can't make up her mind about which one to be with. XXX XXXXXXXXX is the villain who has a list of 125 people to be killed who is says are anarchists and thieves. There is a great cast that also has XXXX XXXXXXX, XXXX XXXXXX and a young XXXXXX XXXXXX.
