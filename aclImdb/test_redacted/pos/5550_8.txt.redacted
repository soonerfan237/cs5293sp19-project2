Treading XXXXX is a very beautiful movie. I would put it straight under the wonderful short movie : Cosa bella from XXXXX MacKenzie. It's not only about coming out but also about tolerance and acceptance in general. I am looking forward to seeing more of XXXXXX Himmel's work in the future. The actors, XXXXX Redman and Nina Landey are quite good. The main characters relationship could have been strenghtened a bit as we understand there is a very strong bond between them but maybe this could have been explained a bit. I am surprised that XXXXX Redman doesn't appear much in other movies. A great first step as a director for XXXXXX Himmel, I am sure there's more to see from her skills.
