The Andrew Davies adaptation of the XXXXX Waters' novel was excellent. The characters of XXX and and Kitty were superbly portrayed by Rachael Stirling and Kelley Hawes respectively. The whole series was a total joy to watch. It caught the imagination of everyone across the board, whether straight or gay. I wish there could be a sequel!
