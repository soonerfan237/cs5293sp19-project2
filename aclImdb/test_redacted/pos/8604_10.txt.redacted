This is a pretty faithful adaptation of XXXXXX XXXXX's novel, "XXXXX XXXX." Like the book it is very moving and thought-provoking. The story revolves around a couple's attempts to see their niece successfully married. They are having trouble finding suitors because of a rumor that she suffers from radiation sickness, after walking through XXXXXXXXX on the day of the bombing. Well filmed, well acted, moving, tragic, horrifying and funny.
