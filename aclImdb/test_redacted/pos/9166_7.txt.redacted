This movie was much better than I expected. After a couple of films by XXXX XXXXX that weren't that great like I, XXXXX, he is back to being likable and fun in this one. Smith plays, XXXXX, a date doctor. Most of the film centers around him teaching XXXXXX how to be himself and get a date with XXXXXXX XXXX, a rich famous celebrity whom he works with. XXXXXX is a klutz and goof and always tripping on his feet or what-not. All XXXXX does is teach him how to act more cool and not be so nervous around XXXXXXX.<br /><br />During all this, XXXXX meets XXXX, a gossip columnist whom has sworn off men. XXXXX charms her, so of course, they go out. But, XXXXX may teach other guys how to get the girl to fall for them, he doesn't believe in love himself. He has never really had a girl since he was dumped in college. But, he likes XXXX, so keeps going after her. XXXX's friend is hurt by guy whom she thinks went to the date doctor. So XXXX tracks the doctor down, only to learn its XXXXX. So of course, she thinks he's a pig. Then it's up to hitch to explain to XXXX and XXXXXXX what he does, so they both end up forgiving.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: Good, has some laughs, and is entertaining. I recommend it.
