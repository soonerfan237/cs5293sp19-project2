I caught this movie on TV yesterday. I had a certain curiosity about it, being that it was directed by XXXXXX XXXXXXX and starring him and his real-life Dad, XXXXXX XXXXX. I love to see a movie about a father-son relationship that involves a real-life father and son. Naturally, there's an instant chemistry between XXXXX and XXXXXXX, and their scenes of conflict are even more intense, knowing that they're actually related. Of course, it helps that the two of them are both terrific actors. I've seen XXXXXX XXXXX in intense roles before, but I think this is XXXXXX's most intense role--being that I mostly recall him from the "XXXXXX XXXXX" series--and I was very impressed. XXXXXX REALLY does run in that family. And XXXXX XXXXX steals the movie in an Oscar-worthy performance. She tugged at my heartstrings with every word of dialogue. Kimberly XXXXXXXX--the beautiful actress from the "Father of the Bride" movies--is also very good, holding her own among a group of talented veteran actors. <br /><br />The movie is a bit stagey, with dialogue that's obviously geared for the stage, but that didn't bother me. This is not meant to be an action movie; this is a character study. And for a film that's based on a play, it never gets too claustrophobic. When XXXXXX's character, Jeremy, reminisces to his days in Vietnam, we actually see his harrowing memories brought to life. <br /><br />The film is extremely powerful and realistic, without being sentimental. At the end, I expected all the conflicts to be resolved and the family would become hunky-dory, but that's not how it turned out. The ending made me cry, without resorting to standard XXXXXXXXX melodrama. That proves reality is much more gripping than anything XXXXXXXXX can conjure up. <br /><br />If you're in the mood for a beautiful, powerful drama with extremely wonderful performances that will knock your socks off...please check out this underrated gem. Hopefully, one day XXXXXX and XXXXXX will unite with XXXXXXX, and they will all make a great film together. <br /><br />My score: 9 (out of 10)
