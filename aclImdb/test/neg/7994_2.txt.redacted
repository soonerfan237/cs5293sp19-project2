XXXXXX Nero stars as XXXX a ninja who comes to the rescue of his war buddy XXXXX XXXXXXX (XXXX XXXXXXXX) and his fetching wife (XXXXX XXXXXX) to protect them from a mobster (XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXX) who wants the land. Things get even more complicated when the mobster hires XXXX's old nemesis (Sho Kosugi) who is also a ninja. Inept martial arts actioner, while having better production values then most ninja movies, fails to inject any life into the surroundings, or for that matter actionscenes. A poor effort all around.
