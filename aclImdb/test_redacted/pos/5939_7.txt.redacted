This was essentially a remake of "XXXXXXXXX Murder" minus Victoria Rowell, Scott Baio & Charlie Schlatter. Dick is playing a college professor who teaches Criminology 101 and can't even find his own classroom. XXXXX is now a private eye, not related to Dick. This lets XXXXX shoot at guys speeding away from him, which a cop can not do. XXXXX still gets the girl in the end. XXXXXX Needham portrays the girl. She is the prime suspect and XXXX and Barry believe she's innocent and prove it. That's all the spoiler you get. The ending is sufficiently unexpected that you don't already know it half way through the movie.<br /><br />Don't take it seriously. Don't critique it. Just sit back and enjoy XXXX and Barry Van Dyke.
