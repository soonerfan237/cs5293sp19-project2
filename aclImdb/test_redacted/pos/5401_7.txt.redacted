The NYT review says that XXXXXXXXX XXXXXX's character is taut and frustrated, and, later, that she could be the sister of MTM's character in Ordinary People. Say, WHAT? No way. This lady was quirky from the start. NOTHING like MTM in Ordinary People. Sorry.<br /><br />Next, the NYT goes on to say that XXXXXXXXX XXXXXX's XXXXX XXXXXX and XXXX XXXXXX's XXX XXXXXX are 40-something year olds, "children of the 60s." Ms Weaver must be dancing a jig. I believe at the time she made XXXXXXXXX XXXXXX she was in fact 55 years old. She was born in 1949.<br /><br />NYT perception corrections aside, this was a pretty good movie considering it was made by someone so young. Obviously XXXXXXXXX XXXXXX thought so, and so did XXXX XXXXXXs. The young man playing XXX was outstanding.<br /><br />There are some critical comments I could make about the script. Such as that I never really got a good sense of why XXXXX XXXXXX missed her son. Her sort of blown apart behavior was perhaps triggered by his death, but that such behavior lasted Â¾ of the way through the film I felt had more to do with her stagnation marriage, her relationship with XXX, and where he really came from, and other unresolved issues, than from any mourning of her elder son. XXX's mourning was much more clear.<br /><br />So XXXX XXXXXX was an asshole. Did his mom think so too? Still, a very watchable film. What is becoming clearer and clearer is not that there are no roles for women over a certain age, rather that what it takes is a director such as this one to be so clearly in love with an older woman (Ms Weaver) and to almost make his film an homage to her. Sort of an anti-Woody Allen.
