I rented this obscure aussie relic a few years ago to show at a friend`s place and it was an instant success.The classic tale of the wizard of oz with a decidedly cornball 70`s australian twist.The acting isn`t exactly shakespeare society stuff here,but later ,"Mad max"star XXXXX XXXXXX is a beautifully understated surfie/scarecrow and there are some wonderfull comic turns by XXXX XXXXXX and XXXXX XXXXXX as a deliciously 70`s camp fairy godmother/father character.Also note the musical contribution from ex-Daddy Cool frontman XXXX XXXXXX on the title song.In a similar vein to later-day aussie comedies such as "Priscilla queen of the desert".Good fun.
