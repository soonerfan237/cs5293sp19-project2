Unlike some of the former commentators, I was (and am) an avid fan of the Carpenters. Face it, XXXXXXXXX would never be XXXXXXXXX without The Carpenters. That said, I believe the movie did a good, not excellent, job at depicting XXXXX's life. The movie was enjoyable to see on primetime TV, but the content fell a little short. I suggest that you all look into getting some of the Carpenters specials that were shown in the 70's. You cannot believe how awesome a drummer XXXXX was. XXXXXXX did not capture the extent of XXXXX's talent. Also, XXXXX was beautiful but had a bad hairdresser. My choice for playing XXXXX is XXXXXX XXXXX. I would love to see a more substantive story, because there was more to XXXXX than meets the eyes when listening to We've Only XXXX XXXXX. I have tons of unreleased Carpenters' music, and it is absolutely excellent. (Her singing of California Dreamin is to die for).
