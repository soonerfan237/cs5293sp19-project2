It really is a great film (after being able to ignore XXXXX XXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXX references which he appears to be obsessed with and are hugely unfunny). XXXXX is, as usual, wonderful - singing and acting brilliantly. I remember seeing it at the Odeon Cinema in the Haymarket, London on its release. However XXXXX's non-appearance at the UK premiere of STAR! was most unfortunate and (apparently!) due to filming the aerial shots for Darling XXXX over Ireland. A reasonable excuse if she had appeared in any of these aerial shots but she did not. Two box office flops in a row ruined her film career for quite a few years. But Darling XXXX,just like STAR!, deserves much more public appreciation.
