The only thing romantic about this movie is the pain and anguish of romance. If you are expecting this cinematic adaptation of another XXXXXXXX Sparks novel to follow the surefire formula of previous films, such as "Message in a Bottle," "Nights at Rodanthe," and "A Walk to Remember," think again. Nobody dies from an accident trying to save somebody else and the romance here doesn't transform these characters. If anything, it makes them even more miserable than they were.<br /><br />A soft-spoken Special Forces Army Sergeant, XXXX Tyree (Channing Tatum of "G.I. XXX"), has a memorable two-week fling while on leave from the military with an impressionable college girl, Savannah Curtis (radiant Amanda Seyfriend of "Mamma Mia"), who is spending spring break in South Carolina. Savannah doesn't drink, smoke, but she tells XXXX that her head is filled with profanity. Inevitably, XXXX and Savannah topple madly in love with each other and launch an endless exchange letters of love letters that are sleep-inducing by any standard. Tyree is off in the world serving the military in some godforsaken corner of the globe while she is away at college perusing his letters in class. Just as they are getting hot and heavy between them, suicidal terrorists crash planes into the World Trade Center. XXXX reenlists along with his buddies in a wave of patriotism without discussing the option with Savannah.<br /><br />Meanwhile, another guy, shaggy but likable family friend Tim (Henry Thomas of "E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial") who has a motherless, autistic child named XXXX becomes the object of Savannah's sentiment. She is the kind of girl who helps build houses for the less fortunate and wants to start a summer horse ranch for autistic children. She delays what seems forever before she finally contacts XXXXX with the eponymous letter. Indeed, she dumps him for a man with a disease! Later, she confesses to XXXX that she knew the sound of his voice would have broken her resolve to marry Tim, so she doesn't make that fateful call. Predictably, XXXX agonizes over Savannah's lack of communication. During a routine mission, our hero takes a couple of terrorist bullets in the back and winds up in Germany. While all this is transpiring, XXXXX is trying to come to terms with his own coin-collecting father, Mr. XXXXX (Richard Jenkins of "Step Brothers"), who suffers from Asperger's Syndrome. It seems that his father is on his last legs after XXXX gets out of the hospital. The lead female character lacks a shred of respect and her betrayal of Tyree amounts to a pretty low blow. XXXXX, his father, and XXXXX's commander, Keith Robinson, are the only sympathetic characters in this long distance epistolary romance. <br /><br />"Dear XXXX" gives new meaning to lethargic love stories. Yuck!
