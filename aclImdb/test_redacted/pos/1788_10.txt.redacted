After the across-the-board success of MY NAME IS BARBRA, CBS television permitted XXXXXX to create an even more elaborate follow-up as her second special. XXXXXXXXX wisely knew, in order to follow in the ground-breaking success of MY NAME IS BARBRA, that her second special would indeed need to raise the bar even further in inventiveness and spectacle. Not surprisingly, she succeeded once again. Even more impressively, XXXXXXXXX managed to mount this large production without sacrificing the intimacy and vision of MY NAME IS BARBRA.<br /><br />Once again, the special is divided into three distinct Acts. Filming on location at Bergdorf Goodman's department store was so successful in the first special, that XXXXXXXXX and company decided to film on location once again for the first Act of this second special. The decided-upon location this time was the Philadelphia Art Museum, which would allow endless chances for XXXXXX to "enter" different art works that would correspond with the songs being performed. In addition to the numerous artistic possibilities that this location made possible, the museum would offer the perfect opportunity to take advantage of filming in color.<br /><br />After the recording of "XXXX XX a Circle" that is set against the opening credits, XXXXXX then dashes around the museum in a maid costume to the strains of Kern and XXXXXXX's "Yesterdays." She stops to admire various paintings and statues, often becoming the character that is depicted and singing a thematically appropriate song. XXXXXXXXX performs a bittersweet rendition of Hammerstein and XXXXXXX's "One Kiss" as XXXXXX XXXXX's CONCERT SINGER, delivers a hilariously campy performance of Chopin's "XXXXXX XXXXX" as XXXXX XXXXXXXXXX, embraces abstract art with the frenetic rhythm of XXXXX XXXX's "Gotta Move," and performs a wrenching rendition of "XXX C'est Rien" as a distraught XXXXXXXXXX girl. The high point of Act I, however, is when XXXXXXXXX compares profiles with the bust sculpture of Egyptian Queen Nefertiti, while singing a tour de force rendition of Rogers and XXXX's "Where or When." The Act II circus medley allows XXXXXXXXX to interact with various farm and circus animals, while singing various songs with farm/circus/animal themes. Some highlights include XXXXXX singing "Were Thine That Special Face" to a baby elephant, performing "I've Grown XXXXXXXXXX to that Face" as a serenade to a piglet, the campy "XXX, You Made the Pants to Long" sung to a group of baby penguins, and XXXXXX comparing profiles with an anteater while crooning "We Have So Much in Common." XXXXXXXXX also swings on a trapeze and leaps from a trampoline to the chorus of "Spring Again," and then slows things down by performing a haunting version of "I Stayed XXX XXXX at the Fair" while seated alone on stage. XXXXXX also gets the chance to show off her pet poodle XXXXX in this segment, and even speak a little French.<br /><br />The Act III concert is once again the high point of the hour. Dressed in a slenderizing white wool dress, the concert segment is performed on a uniquely-designed stage with a partial staircase that leads nowhere. XXXXXXXXX opens the Act with a sultry rendition of Harold Arlen's "Anyplace I XXXX XX XXX Is XXXX," before launching into heartfelt versions of the familiar standard "It Had to Be You" and the rarely-heard "C'est Si Bon (It's So Good)." XXXXXXXXX then really amazes the audience with a breathtakingly powerful, octave-soaring performance of the Sweet Charity ballad "Where Am I Going," of which XXXXXXXXX delivers the definitive rendition of. XXXXXXXXX also introduces the then-newly written XXXXXXX XXXXXX, Jr.-David Shire ballad "Starting Here, Starting Now," which contains an impassioned vocal from XXXXXXXXX that ranks among the very best vocal performances of her long career.<br /><br />More than anything else, Color Me XXXXXX was a showcase for XXXXXXXXX's ever-increasing, mega-watt star power. Despite the presence of even more visual razzle-dazzle, XXXXXXXXX herself is always the main attraction. Her voice sounds as beautiful as ever, and this special was the first to showcase how strikingly she photographs in color. As with MY NAME IS BARBRA, COLOR ME BARBRA was another rating-smash and spawned yet another Top-Five, Gold-selling soundtrack album. XXXXXX put, COLOR ME BARBRA defies tradition and emerges as a sequel that is nearly on par with a classic original.
