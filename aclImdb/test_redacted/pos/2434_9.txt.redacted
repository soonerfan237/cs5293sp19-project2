Sacchi is the best Bogart impersonator ever... dry and droll as XXX XXXXXXX. The music from award winning composer XXXXXX XXXXXX [From Here To Eternity, Picnic, The World of XXXXX XXXX], the cinematography of perfect locations [including the famous Ambassador XXXXX] are all right on target as famous tv director XXXXXX Day [Kojak, XXXXXXX of San Francisco, The Avengers] guides the most endearing group of well-known character actors through a spoof of every dark detective film every made. See this if you loved all the old serious flicks and have a sense of humor... this one is a hoot.
