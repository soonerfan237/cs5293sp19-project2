Well, I've just seen XXXXXX Keaton's film debut in Fatty Arbuckle's The Butcher Boy and-despite the crude way everything just seems to happen for almost no logical reason-I found plenty to laugh at. Like when XXXXXX orders molasses from butcher boy Fatty, Fatty makes XXXXXX come back to pay, XXXXXX says he put it in the bucket that has the molasses, Fatty dumps molasses in XXXXXX's hat and takes money, XXXXXX takes hat back on head as it gets stuck, Fatty attempts to remove it while molasses fall to floor, XXXXXX's feet are now stuck on floor and so on. That probably didn't read funny but on screen it was hilarious as were some more slapstick involving flour being thrown and a later sequence that takes place in XXXXX's girlfriend's boarding school with XXXXX dressed in drag and Buster helping XXXXX's rival also in drag. Like I said, many scenes don't make a lick of sense but the visuals, especially those involving XXXXXXXX and Keaton, are laugh inducing even today. Recommended viewing for Keaton completists.
