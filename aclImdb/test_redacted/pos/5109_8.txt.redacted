If you only see one XXXXXX movie in your life, make it this one! This is by far the best in the series, with its nonstop laughs and clever humor that is suitable for all ages. The other "XXXXXX" flicks were good too, but most people tend to get tired of him quickly (not ME, however.).<br /><br />In this movie, XXXXXX XX XXXXXXX is assigned jury duty for a murder case. The murderer, Nash, just happens to look EXACTLY like our bumbling hero XXXXXX. XXX Nash finds this a good opportunity to escape from jail by knocking him out switching identities with him, and so we get to see how XXXXXX reacts in the slammer.<br /><br />A great flick! If you haven't already seen it, watch it!
