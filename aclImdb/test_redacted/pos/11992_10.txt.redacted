Like XXXXXXX Pryor, Mason never got the material he deserved. Whatever you know of him is probably wrong. Get past the accent and go see his stand-up. You'll be very surprised -- he's one of the best stand-ups I've ever seen and I have seen a lot of stand-up comedy (from XXXXX Bruce to Eddie Murphy to Jerry Seinfeld to Chris Rock -- Jackie Mason is definitely up there). He's known for being a comic's comic. Even XXXXXX Stern said he is one of the top 3 funniest comedians ever.<br /><br />The accussation that Mason is no Dangerfield is ridiculous. Dangerfield is known for having been a huge XXXXX fan. Dangerfield's career was going nowhere for a long time until he started following XXXXX's shows. That is when XXXXX provided Dangerfield with inspiration for his, "get no respect" routine. While I think XXXXXXXXXXX is great, see them both do stand-up and you'll see Mason is the better comedian.
