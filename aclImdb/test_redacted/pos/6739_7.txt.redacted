This is a gently amusing coming-of-age comedy that comes from the later, more mature period of XXXX XXXXX's writing. Although there are plenty of wisecracks to go around, this is not one of those XXXX XXXXX pieces where every character spouts out one-liner jokes for 2 hours like they're guest stars on a XXX XXXX special. There are also dramatic elements (some work, some are overkill) that lend some weight to the story.<br /><br />The performances are good across the board, especially XXXXXX XXXXXX as the mother (although she and XXXXXX XXXX were oddly WASP-ish choices to play Jewish women). I've never been a fan of XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX, but I will say that he hits the right notes as the obnoxious, gawky, and totally horned-up teen-age narrator/protagonist of the story.<br /><br />The movie is very similar in tone to XXXXX XXXXX's "XXXXX XXXX," but the latter is far more imaginative and funny than this one.
