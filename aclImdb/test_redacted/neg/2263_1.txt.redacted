...But not this one! I always wanted to know "what happened" next. We will never know for sure what happened because GWTW was XXXXXXXX's baby. I am a lifelong fan of Gone With the Wind and I could not have been more repulsed by the movie. I did compare "Scarlett" to the original GWTW because any film worth following GWTW needed to be on the same quality level as the first. XXXXX was cast beautifully, although NO ONE will ever compare to Mr. Gable. I am also a strict XXXXXX Leigh fan!! She WAS XXXXXXXX. She fit the bill. Not another actress in this lifetime or another will ever fit the same shoes but with "Scarlett" the job could have been done better. Not enough thought went into finding the proper XXXXXXXX, that was evident.<br /><br />Overall, something to look to but if you want to know the what happened to XXXXXXXX and Rhett, I suggest writing it yourself or finding fan fiction. This movie is not worth the time.
