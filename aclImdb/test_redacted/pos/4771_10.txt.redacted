It's the 1920s. And a man named XXXX Disney was on a mission: to satisfy the families and children all over the world with one thing: entertainment. What did he do? He made cartoons! Whoo!!!!! And he made a character that is as great as a mouse...XXXXXX Mouse. Ha ha! Oh boy!<br /><br />Two films were drawn out by XXX Disney himself: "Plane Crazy" and "Steamboat Willie." This review will focus on the 1928 feature, "XXXXXXXXX Willie."<br /><br />Ever since I learned about this movie as a little boy, I've always wanted to see this movie. Well, in 1997, I rented an ancient VHS that had lots of old Disney cartoons on them, starring the Mouse!!!!! XXXXXX Mouse!!!!! And guess what? That short was on there, and I loved it!!!!! Shortly after I took the tape back, this was playing on the old XXXXXX Channel (note: the "Old" XXXXXX Channel) early one Saturday Morning.<br /><br />Yes, this is a great cartoon; this paved the way for more great XXXXXX stuff from 1928 to 2002!<br /><br />10 stars, indeed!!!!!
