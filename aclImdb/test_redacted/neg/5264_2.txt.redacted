To keep from being bored during "Love and XXX," first I tried to think of all the movies this was imitative of: "Breaking Up" with Russell Crowe and Salma Hayek (though that had a more original ending), "About Last Night" with Rob Lowe, and a lot of TV shows. <br /><br />Second was admiring just how gorgeous XXXXXX Janssen is so I couldn't believe for a nanosecond that she could have a problem getting a date. She is certainly in line to give XXXXX Roberts a run for her money, literally-- and wasn't XXXXX in some movie with this same plot or other? <br /><br />Third was trying to figure out why the writer/director bothered to give XXX Favreau's character the Jewish name of Adam Levy; he even refers admiringly to eating a ham sandwich.<br /><br />Fourth was trying to figure out why some critics had given this a good review which is why I was in the theater.<br /><br />(originally written 9/2/2000)
