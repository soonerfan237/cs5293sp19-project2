The original "XXXXXXX on Precinct 13" is gritty, witty, and - perhaps most importantly - short. This remake is mercilessly padded out and talky. Worse yet, the African-American hero of the first movie is here replaced with handsome white boy XXXXX Hawke, which makes this "Assault" less progressive than the 1970s one. God, how I miss XXXX Carpenter and his improbable plot line and his weird sense of humor. I even miss his B-list actors, who are leagues better than XXXXX and company.<br /><br />I can't say I care for the new villains in this version - they stretch what little credibility the story ever had to the limit. The female characters are useless, the criminals are all generic hoods, and XXXXXXX Byrne gives another of his bored performances. The music's all wrong, too - it's bland action stuff that actually detracts from the tension. Simply awful.
