My 15 year old daughter asked me to watch this movie with her on Cable TV. As someone who saw XXXXXXX of The Nerds in a movie theater, I found this movie to be an extremely predictable remake of it. The Nerds were simply replaced by XXXXX. I drove her crazy by being able to predict precisely what would happen in each scene. The cast was cute, especially XXXXXX Bynes.<br /><br />Screenwriter Chad Creasey should be ashamed for writing such an obvious remake of an early 1980's flick. The title should have simply been "Revenge of The Dorks." Perhaps the sequel will be XXXXXXX of the Dorks 2.
