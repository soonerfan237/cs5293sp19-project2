XXX Stern and Jeremy Slate are swing bachelor's planning to hijack a casino, ala "Ocean's 11", and pin it on the Hell's Angels. Bad move. For a film with the words XXXX's Angels AND the number 69 AND featuring actual XXXX's Angels, this movie is surprisingly tame. The Hell's XXXXXX truly deserve a better film to be centered around them. Not this snoorefest. Luckily this is one of the DVDs that features commentary by XXX Bob Briggs so the pain of having to sit through it is greatly alleviated. If you watch it any other way, let me recommend something to you. DON'T!! <br /><br />My Grade: D <br /><br />DVD Extras: XXX Bob Brigg's commentary; Conny Van Dyke's message to her fans (she has more than one?); Photo gallery; Theatrical XXXXXXX; and XXXXXXXs for "Blood Shack", "Hell High", "Samurai Cop", and "The Hollywood Strangler"
