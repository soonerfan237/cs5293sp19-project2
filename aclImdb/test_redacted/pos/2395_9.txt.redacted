XXXXX Monroe is Hooooot. He is a great actor and I could be his girl anytime. He's so fine. I was so sad at the end. I'm not going to ruin the end but wow. Girls are so vicious. His girl was wrong. If XXXXX was my man I would never disrespect. Those Mobsters were spooky. The moral of the story is XXXXX No One. Your friends will hurt u if they can. Oh and XXXXX tell your girlfriend that yo mine, she should move ova! I would suggest seeing the movie. Why? Becasur I said so. It kept my eyes on the screen. My sister loved it also so I am going to see it again because now my friends want to see it and its worth seeing two times. Peace,XXXXX New Year!
