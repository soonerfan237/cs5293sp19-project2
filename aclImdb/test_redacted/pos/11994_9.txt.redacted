Everyone is entitled to an opinion. The only critic who counts is yourself. I think this is a great movie. Much better than the original.<br /><br />In "Caddyshack", XXXXXX Dangerfield is funny, but obnoxious. He was asked to do the sequel, but things got in the way. XXXXXX Mason shows the saying that "less is more". He is funny, but a man with real family issues, a more rounded person. It's no drama, but a movie that makes you feel. Actually in some points, you feel sorry for XXXXXX Mason, especially when his daughter walks out on him.<br /><br />It has a good soundtrack, and overall, a good sorry. A good end to the series.<br /><br />In the TV show "XXX", XXX says that he cried in "Terms of Endearment". The wife , Kate Tanner, played by XXXX Schedeen, also says he cried at "Caddyshack 2".
