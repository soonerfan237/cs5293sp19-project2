I haven't actually seen a lot of movies with XXXXX Hunter, but seeing her in Broadcast News was a pleasant surprise. She is a hard-nosed journalist, XXXX Craig, who has devoted all of her time to TV news show. Her colleague XXXXX Altman has carried her torch for a long time without saying anything. The love triangle is completed by XXX Grunnick. He is the slightly aloof ex-sportscaster who is the new reporter. To XXXX, he symbolizes everything she doesn't like about news reporting - turning it into edutainment, not serious business. Much to her surprise, XXXX finds herself attracted to Tom.<br /><br />Holly Hunter is doing a great performance as the perky journalist. But I don't quite see what she finds so charming about her new colleague, XXX. It's something with them that prevents us from getting up close and personal with him. Almost as impressive is XXXXXX Brooks, who gives his all in the role of a professional who gives more than 100 percent for his job but doesn't get quite as much in return. Actually, for a while I thought he was XXXXX Guttenberg from Police Academy (1984). He has a few funny lines and if this was a Meg Ryan-picture, they'd call it a romantic comedy.<br /><br />Running over two hours, a few scenes could have been edited or left out completely, eg. XXXX's and Aaron's trip to Central America. Also, I'm a sucker for happy endings and had preferred a different ending than just a reunion between the three of them seven years later.
