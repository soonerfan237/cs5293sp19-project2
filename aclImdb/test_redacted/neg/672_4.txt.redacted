The CinemaScope color cinematography of XXXX Shamroy is quite remarkable here,including his use of colored filters for<br /><br />various scenes. The Alfred Newmann Score has to be the most sensual and seductive score XXXXXXXXX ever produced. It's a shame it is no longer available on CD. The actors, however, never rise to the occasion. The accents are so varied, from the subdued British of XXXXXXX and Purdom to the Hollywood of Baxter and Mature that it seems a true hodgepodge with no central vision. XXXXX Rettig is jarringly American. Acting styles span the range from zombie-like to stilted. Only XXXXXXX as a conniving one-eyed servant steals the show - what there is of it to steal. The premise - the story of a young Egyptian doctor, seduced and abandoned by the rich - and the parallel theme of the cult of the single God, Ra - persecuted by the authorities, has its interesting points. But when the film's plot fades, it is the haunting music and visuals that remain.
