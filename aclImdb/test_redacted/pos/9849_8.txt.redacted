XXXX Practice was a British drama series about a GP surgery in XXXXXXX  a small fictional town in the Derbyshire XXXX District  and the doctors who worked there. It ran on ITV from 1993 to 2002, and was one of their most successful series at the time. It originally starred XXXXX XXXXXXX as Dr XXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXXXX XXXXXX as Dr Beth Glover, and XXXXX XXXXXXXX as Dr XXXX XXXXXXX, though the roster of doctors would change many times over the course of the series.<br /><br />The series was axed in 2002 and ended on a literal cliffhanger when two of the series main characters plunged off a cliff. Viewers wrote to ITV in their thousands and a petition for one last episode was set up by website XXXX Practice Online. However, all pleas were unsuccessful and ITV said they would not make any more episodes.<br /><br />XXXX Practice was replaced by XXXXX XXXXXXXX, another medical series set in Derbyshire. It lasted a few episodes before it was dropped from the schedules.<br /><br />XXXXXXX was based on the Derbyshire village of Crich, and the series was filmed there and at other nearby Derbyshire towns and villages, most notably XXXXXXX and Ashover. After the end of this programme, ITV attempted to launch a follow-up series called XXXXX XXXXXXXX, which extended the stories of different characters from the original show.
