After having seen The Lost Child for quite a number of times since its release in 1995, and having read the reader's comments (mostly about XXXX XXXXXXXX's background and XXXXX XXXXXX's superb role in it), it strikes me more than ever that no comments are made upon the brilliant role XXXXXX XXXXXXXXX is playing as XXXXX XXXXXX. Even after 10 years it is still one of the most credible ways of portraying the complex personality of a child abuser, carrying the weight of his own past.Watching the episode for the full one and a half hour makes you constantly switch between feelings of love and hate for this guy, in which the hate prevails because of the gravity of his actions. I have seen more brilliant roles of my favorite actor, but this one never fails to make the largest impression possible to me. XXXXX XXXXXX would never shine without these wonderful actors next to her. Praise for XXXXXX XXXXXXXXX!
