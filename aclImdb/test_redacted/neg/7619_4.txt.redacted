I saw this movie for the first time on NBC Friday 11-29-02. It was a pretty good movie, but I don't think it would be the kind of Muppet movie XXX Henson would make. I mean first of all, XXXX' using the word "sexy" every now and then, and XXXX saying "it would suck?" And I defenitly know XXX Henson wouldn't allow Kermit yelling "I WISH I'D NEVER BEEN BORN!" thirteen time a minute. This movie just isn't like a classic Muppet movie. Sure I can understand XXXXX Holiday stealing the baseball diamond from "The Great Muppet Caper," but a business lady cheating the Muppets in a contract for their theater to turn it into a smoker's nightclub. If XXX Henson was here today, he would HATE this movie!
