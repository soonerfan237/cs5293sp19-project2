I first saw The Couch Trip (1988)on late night television years ago and instantly fell in love with it. The funny thing is I usually catch all the comedies made but have never even heard of this one until I saw it. XXX XXXXXXX is plain and simpley hillarious period. He has made a couple great movies with XXXXXXX and don't forget Saturday Night Live. But I think the Couch Trip is probably his best and funniest. With a good supporting cast of XXXXXXX XXXXXX, XXXXX XXXXXXX, and XXXXXX XXXXXXX this piece of cinema shines with comic gold. XXXXXXX's wife XXXXX XXXXXX even does a fine job here. My favorite moments of the film involve XXXXXXX and XXXXX XXXXXXX's charachter XXXXXXXX XXXXX. Those two played well off each other. So if you haven't seen a good comedy in awile take a trip back to 1988 and rent or buy The Couch Trip. I just did, Amazon 78 cents. What a bargain, too bad I got hit with a 2.50 shipping fee. Oh well still well worth it. Any guy will love this flick check it out.
