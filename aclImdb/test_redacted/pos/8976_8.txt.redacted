In one of the better movies of the year, XXX XXXXX stars as Congressman XXXXXXX XXXXXX in this sardonically funny and extremely relevant (given reasonably current events) historical comedy-drama surrounding the 1980s Afghan/Soviet fiasco. The Soviets were attacking Afghanistan killing hundreds of people. Why should anyone care? People are dying, right? No, the reason the United States got involved through XXXXXXX XXXXXX was because the Afghans, in fear they would get blown to sh_t, started illegally coming into Pakistan which in turn p_ssed XXXXXXXXX President XXXXXXXX XXX ul-Haq off. XXXXXXX XXXXXX in an effort to fix this situation teamed up with the sixth richest woman and religious fanatic in Texas, XXXXXX XXXXXXX (XXXXX XXXXXXX) and a amusing and robust American spy for the CIA, XXXX XXXXXXXXX (XXXXXX XXXXXXX XXXXXXX) to help supply Afghans with high-tech weapons to destroy Soviet fight air-craft that would try and attack their land.<br /><br />Although certainly not a serious Oscar contender for XXXX XXXXXXX, 'XXXXXXX XXXXXX's War' is probably one of the best of the many political films of the year. XXXXXXX XXXXX XXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXX provides solid directing as to be expected while XXXX XXXXX XXXXXX XXXXX XXXXXX (Sport's Night, The West Wing) provides a remarkable screenplay that near-flawlessly balances comedy and drama. The acting is great for the most part as well. XXX XXXXX delivers his best and most enjoyable performance since his 2000 Oscar-nominated turn as a FedEx worker stranded on a tropical island in 'Cast Away'. Hanks takes a slimy character like XXXXXX and with his trademark charm turns him into a likable guy. XXX XXXXX and XXX XXXXXX are reliable as always, but the real stand-out performance of the film is from XXXXXX XXXXXXX XXXXXXX. Arguably the finest actor working in the film industry today, XXXXXXX takes a small supporting role and upstages everyone around him. From his first scene where he's screaming at his boss before violently breaking his window, XXXXXXX sucks you in. The only disappointing cast member is unsurprisingly overrated XXXXXXXXX starlet XXXXX XXXXXXX. Hamming her way through yet another movie, XXXXXXX' overbearing and over-the-top portrayal of a rich Texas oil woman hits all the wrong notes and is at most times flat-out annoying. At 97 minutes, the movie is short and sweet, and that isn't to say it doesn't drag at some points but when it does drag it's for a very brief amount of time.<br /><br />In conclusion, 'XXXXXXX XXXXXX's War' is not a perfect film by any means, but it's certainly worth a look. Grade: B+
