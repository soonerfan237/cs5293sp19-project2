"Murder Over New York" is an entertaining entry in the XXXXXXX XXXX series of films, but if you're paying attention, a lot of plot holes reveal themselves to the observant eye. While traveling to New York City for an annual police convention, XXXX (Sidney Toler) meets former Scotland Yard investigator XXXX XXXXX (XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXX) on the same flight. Now employed by military intelligence, XXXXX is tracking XXXX XXXXX and his XXXXX servant, suspected for acts of sabotage around the world. XXXXX believes that by contacting XXXXX's elusive wife, he'll be able to pin down the whereabouts of the master criminal.<br /><br />When XXXXX winds up dead in the library of XXXXXX XXXXX, president of the Metropolitan Aircraft Corporation, XXXXXXX theorizes that he was killed by a recently discovered poisonous gas called "tetrogene", administered via a glass pellet that releases the poison when broken. Summoning XXXXX to bring all of his dinner party guests together, XXXX and Police XXXXXXXXX XXXXX (XXXXXX XXXXXXXX) question those in attendance, as one of them may be the killer. Among them are XXXXXXX XXXXXX (Melville Cooper), a fellow Oxford student of XXXXX's, actress June Preston (Joan Valerie), unknown to XXXXX but requested by him to attend, XXXXX XXXXX (Kane Richmond), the chief designer at XXXXX's aircraft company, and XXXXX XXXXXXX (XXXX XXXXXX), XXXXX's stock broker. XXXXX butler XXXXX (Leyland Hodgson) is also a suspect, especially after Number #2 XXX XXXXX (XXXXXX XXX XXXX) catches him steaming open a cablegram, the contents of which concern XXXXX himself.<br /><br />There are some other cleverly planted characters in the proceedings as well. Mrs. XXXXX turns up as XXXXXXXX XXXX (XXXXXXXX XXXXXX), and contrary to XXXXX's suspicion that she might lead him to XXXXX, is actually on the run away from her former husband and a disastrous marriage. She's involved with XXXXX XXXXXXX (XXXXXX XXXXXX), principal of a chemical research firm, and thereby a suspect in the tetrogene angle.<br /><br />As with many XXXX films, racial comments must be taken in stride with the proceedings. This one offers two glaring ones. When XXXXX's black servant is brought in for questioning, he states that he doesn't know anything about XXXXX's murder, that he's completely "in the dark". XXXX's response: "Condition appear contagious".<br /><br />Later, following XXXXXXXXX XXXXX's order to round up all the XXXXX's in New York, XXXXX XXXX comments on their arrival with "They're all beginning to look alike to me." Actually, the scene provides one of the elements of comic relief in the movie, as XXXXX XXXXXX impersonates XXXXX mystic "The Great Rashid", but is actually uncovered by the police to be con artist XXXXXX McCoy.<br /><br />Before the movie's over, two more victims fall to the clever XXXXX - his confederate XXXXXXXX, and aircraft magnate XXXXX himself. To uncover the killer, XXXX, in concert with XXXXXXX, arranges for a test flight aboard a newly developed TR4 Bomber after discovering a poisoned capsule planted by mechanics on the plane the day before. Before it can release it's deadly poison, the Brit XXXXXX catches the falling capsule in mid-air, revealing that he knew about the plant. Arrested and brought in for questioning, XXXX asserts that XXXXXX is not XXXXX. The real XXXXX reveals himself when he offers a poisoned cup of water to the nervous XXXXXX, anxious to maintain XXXXX's secret. But XXXX was clever enough to be wary of such an attempt, and reveals the real murderer - XXXXX now in the guise of stock broker XXXXXXX, having undergone reconstructive surgery following a car accident.<br /><br />Now for the plot holes. When first investigating XXXX XXXXX's murder, it was maintained by the police that fingerprints found in the library did not match those of any of the dinner guests. However XXXXXXX/XXXXX was present at the dinner party. It had already been established that XXXXX had one non party visitor in the library, chemist XXXXXXX. If the fingerprints really did not belong to XXXXX, then making them an issue was pointless.<br /><br />Also, at the end of the film when XXXXX offers XXXXXX the poisoned water, how did he think he would get away with it with everyone there as a witness? But going even one better than that, how would a world traveling saboteur like XXXXX have the time and wherewithal to establish himself as a New York City stockbroker, it just doesn't make sense. <br /><br />For trivia fans, a few more points bear mentioning. In the film, Number #2 XXX XXXXX is a college student studying chemistry as he comes to "XXX's" aid to solve the case. In the prior XXXX film - "XXXXXXX XXXX at the Wax Museum" - XXXXX was a law student.<br /><br />The poison gas formula would get reworked in a later XXXX film, this time by XXXXXXXX with XXXXXX XXXXXXX in the XXXX role in "Docks of New Orleans". In that story, poison gas is released from shattered radio tubes in similar fashion to claim its' victims.
