It's particularly hard for a director to capture film-making without getting precious, inbred, over-dramatic, or all three. XXXXXXXX ably demonstrates the instinctive, lizard-brain methods of a female auteur in extracting from two "cattle" (as XXXXXXXXX called actors) a love-scene of searing intimacy. Her main battle is with her leading man ("an actor is really a woman" she opines), although, naturally, it is the leading lady who will steal the show. I disagree that this is XXXXXXXX's first comedy. 'Romance' was at various points hilarious, but I accept that the French sense of humour can be elusive for foreigners; indeed, dozens of IMDb reviewers detected no comedy in Romance. By contrast, XXX Is Comedy raises plenty of laughs, mainly by using an actor's prop that goes back thousands of years to Plautus and the ancient Greeks. We wondered, leaving the theatre, whether XXXXXX's "beard" was a wig. A lovely performance from XXXX XXXXXXXXX as XXXXXXXX wrestling with her own script, looking ten years younger than her age.
