I've seen XXXXXXXX Dove, Dead Man's Walk, and The Streets of Laredo, and now The Return to XXXXXXXX Dove. If you are hungry for more after watching XXXXXXXX Dove, this'll fill yer belly. Great cast, great story. Most definitely a close second to XXXXXXXX Dove. I will be purchasing this movie to add to my collection. This is the best, or at least my favorite performance by XXX Voight. He is XXXXXXX Call. XXX Gossett Jr. playing Isom Pickett is not somebody I'd mess with, he is a bad ass with perspective. XXXXXXX Peterson does a great job as well. XXXX Schroder is back as Newt with an angst filled performance that reminds me of his stint on NYPD Blue. My only problem with this film (and it's really picking nits) is that I had the impression that XXXX wanted to be "the first man to graze cattle in Montana", and it's obvious that Dunnigan had already been there a while. A little inconsistent, but easily overlooked as you lose yourself in the fantastic tale. I especially love the apparent character growth of XXXXXX Fant and July Johnson. I've watched this movie several times and am ready for another sequel.
