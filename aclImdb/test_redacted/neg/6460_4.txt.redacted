Why is Guy working for XXXXX? Probably because XXX was not around in 1995. Why does XXXX want to be with Guy? For access to Buddy. Why does she stay with XXX? I am not sure.<br /><br />There are bunch of things about this movie that I am not sure about. But, XXXXX Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor.<br /><br />Frank Whaley's Guy is certainly out of his element working for Buddy  he wants to write and make meaningful movies, not be a gofer that is verbally abused for getting Equal instead of Sweet & Low. <br /><br />XXXXXXXX Forbes' Dawn, who also wants to make meaningful movies, seems way out of Guy's league.<br /><br />The ending leaves a lot to be desired.
