I concur with what mallicka.b has said. The movie is portrayed in a way which appears to be a kind of vilification on the original content. Emotions aren't conveyed properly. I guess a couple of not-so-good performances also contributed to its mediocrity. In my view, XXXX would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of Aishwarya Rai. In some of her scenes, she looks a bit lusty, which is not ultimately what the movie should have portrayed. I also noticed a bit of over-acting in some of her scenes. I'm a bitter critic of XXXXXXXXX Rai :) Can't help it; sorry for that. 'Raincoat' was a good movie by XXXXXXXXX Ghosh. And I saw XXXXXX Bali after seeing Raincoat; I was not at all impressed.
