During the brief Golden Age of the Super 8 Magnetic Sound Home Movies, we purchased a GAF Projector for $148.00 on close-out at a Downtown Chicago Camera Store. It seemed that GAF was getting out of the Camera & Projector Business; although they would continue with their other enterprises, such as the former Sawyer's Vue-XXXXXX 3 Dimensional color slide viewers.<br /><br />Little did we know nor anticipate the rapid approach of the Video Camera, the Betamax, the VHS and the eventual DVD revolutions. With the Super 8 Magnetic Sound Camera that we also purchased, we took some sound film records as our Daughter, XXXX's First XXXX XXXXXXXXX and her younger Sister, XXXXXXXX's Graduation from Pre-School. This was all circa 1979-82.<br /><br />During this time we also purchased a few XXXXX XXXX to go with it; like some Super 8 Magnetic Sound LAUREL & HARDY Films and W.C. FIELDS' Shorts from XXXXXXXXX XXXXX, XXXXXXXXX, Iowa. We also picked up a Columbia Pictures Home Movies Sound Film of a then sort of forgotten XXXXXXX XXXXXXX, UPA's GERALD McBOING-BOING (XXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX of America/Columbia, 1951). It was THE hit of our Home Movies Time! <br /><br />Being members of that XXXX XXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX, the Wife (Deanna) and meself had recollection of the Character of XXXXXX McBoing-Boing; for XXXXXX had a XXXXXXX TV Show on CBS, early Sunday Evenings, ca. 1955. XXXX XXXXXXX was the Announcer/Host. But we had never seen this original UPA Theatrical Cartoon; nor was it known to us that the young XXXXXX McBoing-Boing was a creation of Dr. Seuss of "Grinch", "XXXXXX" and "XXXXXXXX XXXXXX" fame.<br /><br />THE staff assembled was very talent rich and deep. The outstanding production values are apparent. Director XXXXXX XXXXXX and Supervisoring Director XXXX XXXXXX were veterans at the top of their craft. Writers were Theodore Geisel (Dr. Seuss, Himself), XXXX XXXXXXX and XXXX Scott.<br /><br />Mr. Scott is remembered not so much for his writing contributions to UPA, but for being partners with XXX XXXX in such Television Properties as ROCKY & BULLWINKLE, XXX XXXXXXX, FRACTURED FLICKERS, GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE, HOPPITY HOOPER and FRACTURED FLICKERS. With the XXX XXXX Productions he was a writer, voice man and Kibitzer-General of the whole company.<br /><br />The cartoon receives its only "voice" from the Narrator, Radio/Movie/TV Actor XXXXXX XXXXXX. Remember him? He was XXXXXXX XXXXXXX on the TV Ssries THE MILLIONAIRE (Don Fedderson Productions/CBS Television XXXXXXX, 1955-60).<br /><br />Bold color schematic and imaginative design went into giving the UPA animations a special feelings of loneliness, fear apprehension and eventual triumph. And, we might add, the animation is definitely of the "Limited" Variety.<br /><br />AS with so many great stories, ours starts out with a simple premise; one's being born different. In this case it is young boy XXXXXX McCloy, who has been born to make sound effects in communicating rather than talking. Kids can be cruel and soon he is dubbed with his not so flattering nick name by a group of youthful taunters chanting: "Nya, nya, your name's not McCloy; it's XXXXXX McBoing-Boing, the Noise Making Boy!" AT this point, the Animation Team does an outstanding job in shifting the emotional gears in the young outcast from happy & carefree to isolated & lonely and finally to depression & despair in not being able to turn to anyone for help and understanding; not even to his Mother and Father.<br /><br />A frighteningly fashioned dark scene involving a highly UPA stylized run away scene involving a Train and an equally stylized Snowfall brings XXXXXX right to the brink of absolute despair. But then, he is interrupted by a gentleman announcing that young XXXXXX is wanted by the producer of some Radio Program to provide the sounds for the show down at the Studio.<br /><br />ONCE the premiere show is done with XXXXXX starring in the Sound Department, he rides off in a huge Limousine (which seems to have anticipated those S-t-r-e-t-c-h Limos of our day) to the cheers and admiration of his Classmates and the World.<br /><br />IT has been said that there are only so many plots and, in that case this story is most likely a variation on The Ugly Duckling; for after all, a sad and lonely boy finds his place in the world and true happiness.<br /><br />NOTE: XXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX of America, or UPA for short, was an outstanding center of creativity in the field of the Animated Cartoon. They were responsible not only for GERALD McBOING-BOING and several sequels and a TV XXXXXX, but also the highly popular XXX XXXXX XXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX and subsequent TV Show (with voice talent of XXX XXXXXX), the Classic Original TV Cartoon of FROSTY THE SNOWMAN and the rather bizarre DICK TRACY XXXXXXX XXXX (with XXXXX's voice rendered by XXX XXXXXXX XXXXXX!).
