A hilarious comedy by the best director ever, XX XXXXX. The list of eighties TV icons goes on and on. Milano (Who's The Boss), Yothers (Family Ties), Stone (XXX XXXXXXXXX), Robinson (XXXXX XXXXX), Jackee (227), D'abo (Wonder Years), Walston (Mr. Hand!!!). It is one of the funniest movies ever. Great lines, meaningless subplots, cheesy, bad acting. It is about a group of high school kids who need to pass drivers' ed. Mac from XXXXX XXXXX needs them to pass their final exam, or he'll be fired. Great performance by XXXXX XXXXX as the jerk/kinda cool guy XXXX XXXXXX, but is nothing compared to B.D. Wong's Kiki (pronounced kee-chee). A great movie for all ages, so bad it's good.
