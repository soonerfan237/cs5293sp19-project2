WWII veterans return home and find it hard to adjust to civilian life. This superb drama is expertly directed by XXXXX and beautifully filmed by famed cinematographer Toland. Despite its near three-hour length, it does not drag for a minute. The script by Sherwood features very human characters and great dialog. XXXXXXX has perhaps his best role as a man struggling to make ends meet. Also good are XXXXXX as a love-sick young woman, Mayo as Andrews' trampy wife, and real-life veteran Russell as a man who lost both his hands. However, top honors go to XXXXX and Loy as a long-married couple facing challenges while getting reacquainted with each other.
