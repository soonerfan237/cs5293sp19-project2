Don't you ever miss the good old days when XXXXXX actually made great movies that really moved you? Growing up with XXXXXX I always found myself being captivated by the characters. Every single one seemed truly talented and knew how to act their way through a movie. I remember Friday nights and running to turn on the TV just to watch their newest movies. XXXXX Q was one of my all time favorites. I never forgot this movie. Even till this day when one mentions the song "XXXXX Q" I always remember the movie. If anyone is thinking of watching this movie I promise you, you will fall in love with it. I don't think I will ever be able to forget it. You will not regret watching it. <br /><br />Unfortunately it's sad to see Disney movies such as "The Hannah Montana Movie" come out. What ever happened to Disney?
