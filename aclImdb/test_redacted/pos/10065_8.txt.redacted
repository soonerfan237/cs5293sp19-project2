If this film had been made in the 50's or 60's, critics and fans alike would have praised it. I myself, enjoyed the film from beginning to end. It's not a timeless piece, and has not aged well over the years, but it is enjoyable to watch, nonetheless. As for Mrs. XXXXXXX's acting in the film? Not the best on the planet -- but it adds to the film's unique slapstick comedy-aspirations, and showcases XXXXXXX's (often underrated) sense of comedic timing. Madonna plays XXXXX Finn, an ex-convict who was framed for a crime she didn't commit. XXXXXXX Dunne plays the hapless future groom/puppet who is sent to escort her from prison to the bus station, where a series of unfortunate events occurs, thus creating the plot. (And there *is* one, folks!) Give the film a shot. You might be pleasantly surprised at how funny it really is.
