The Curse of Monkey Island. Released excactly 6 years after the success of Monkey Island 2. You would think with XXXXXX Island 2's wierd ending that it would finish XXXXXX Island once and for all. But, it all turned out to be a trick to lure XXXXXXXX into captivity. But enough about that, the whole jist of this is that XXXXXX Island has returned, and the voices are just phenominal. If LucasArts were to make a movie/cartoon of Monkey Island, this would probably be what it would look like, and sound like. It's plot is real good, and everything about it is just awesome. If you haven't heard about the XXXXXX Island series, buy the XXXXXX Island Archives or The XXXXXX Island Booty Pack and play through all the games starting with The Secret of XXXXXX Island, then XXXXXX Island 2, and The Curse of XXXXXX Island. Monkey Island 4 was real good, but this one tops them all.
