If you are one of those people that think XXXXX XXXXX is all about gore, guts and zombies, you have to watch this (and "The Psychic" too, for that matter). Even though the film does include some quite brutal scenes of violence, and a unsettling subject matter, it's not the main thing here. This is a truly impressive, story and character-driven murder mystery that might well be the director's masterpiece. Here, he proves that he's a real craftsman, creating a memorable, disturbing yet strikingly beautiful masterpiece, filled with creepy Catholic imagery and interesting social commentary. It also has a great cast, including the gorgeous XXXXXXX XXXXXXX, as well as XXXXX XXXXXX (from Beatrice Cenci) and XXXXX XXXXXX in a small but important role. Still, it is Brazilian actress XXXXXXXX XXXXXX (who also stared in Fulci's bizarre "XXXXXX in a woman's skin") who steals the scene in the role of Majara, giving an excellent performance of a woman driven insane by her superstitions, and her vicious murder scene is particularly heartbreaking. The second star of the movie is XXXXXX XXXXXXX's cinematography who, along with the melancholic Morricone-esquire score by XXX XXXXXXXX, help bringing the "secluded Italian village with a dark secret" setting to life. I have to admit thought that the dummy head hitting the rocks kind of pulled me off, but nonetheless, this is a definite Italian horror classic - a moving, sad and ultimately thought provoking work of genius. 10/10 for me. If you liked this one, I recommend watching XXXXXX XXXX's "Alice, XXXXX XXXXX", as they are somewhat similar, and are both underrated gems.
