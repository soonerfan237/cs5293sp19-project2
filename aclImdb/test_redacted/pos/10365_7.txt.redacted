This production was quite good. The usual fabulous scenery, interesting, quirky characters. It was just so strange not to have XXXXXXX Hastings, Miss Lemon, and Poirot's office/residence, so prominently featured in the original PBS/BBC mysteries.<br /><br />In the original series, so much took place at the office. Hastings reading the paper, while XXXXXX "exercises his little gray cells." XXXX Lemon pitching in whenever needed.<br /><br />Poirot without Capt. Hastings would be like XXXXXX without Watson ... he can most certainly solve the crime, but it is not as interesting.<br /><br />And what would a Poirot mystery be without Hastings, with his impeccable manners, falling for some beautiful, unattainable woman.
