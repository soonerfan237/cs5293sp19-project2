XXXX Robot Romantic Comedy Ever, using the robots as the romantic characters, which leaves Short Circuit out of this category. This was XXXX Kaufman's best effort. XXXXXXXXXX Peters shows her versatility here with an amazing performance. While not a great movie in many areas, I'll award it a 9 on guts and quirkiness.
