This is an entertaining surreal road movie. It was written by XXXXXX XXXXXX, who also wrote After XXXXX, XXXXXX XXXXXXXX's excellent surreal film. The film follows the adventures of a ten-year-old kid named XXX, who drives a red Ford XXXXXXX across some fictional states with names like Tristana (A tribute to XXXX XXXXXX's film, perhaps?), XXXXX & South Lyndon, in search of eight elusive Motorama game cards from various Chimera Company gas stations. The film has a surreal feel to it because a lot of the things are unusual, like the money for instance, which is like blank paper with numbers on.<br /><br />Most of the characters are nasty to XXX on his trip. They tattoo him, punch him, but this doesn't stop the kid on his relentless quest. Some oddball actors like XXXXX XXXXX incumbent XXXX XXXXX, XXXX XXXX & XXXX also make appearances. XXXX XXXXX plays a motel owner, who when he first meets XXX tells him, "If you see any squirrels, give them to me". This is a movie where a man and his wife abandon their young children because the man owes XXX $100; and a mother encourages her son to raise his voice louder while speaking rudely. If you're a fan of XXXX XXXXX and surreal movies, you'll like this. An odd little gem of a movie.
