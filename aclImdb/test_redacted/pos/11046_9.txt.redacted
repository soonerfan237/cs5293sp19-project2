Greta Garbo stars in 'Anna Christie', a very early 1930 MGM 'talkie', the first time 'Garbo XXXXX'. 'Anna Christie' is a powerful movie but not for everyone. The movie is filmed like a stage play, short on sets and cinematography, long on dialogue and dramatic characterizations. XXXXXX O'Neil who wrote the play 'Anna Christie' is known for his dark work and Garbo's character Anna Christie is a bleak figure with a tortured past.<br /><br />The sound quality on the DVD was mediocre. Not helping matters is that XXXXXX F. Marion who plays Anna's estranged dad, Chris Christofferson, is verbally hard to understand. XXXXXX gives a good performance as the old drunken seamen who’s teetering on insanity with his fixation of the evil 'devil sea'. But his dialogue is written with a very heavy Swedish accent, this is true to O'Neils original play. XXXXX Dressler's dialogue as Marthy Owens is equally hard to understand. XXXXXXXX believably portrays a broken down old drunken women, a 'wharf rat'. Her dialogue also is true to O'Neils original play as is XXXXXXX Bickford as the Irish seamen, Matt Burke who pursues Anna in a troubled relationship. Garbo is actually the easiest to understand.<br /><br />The films strong point is XXXXX Garbo. She delivers a gut wrenching performance as the victim of neglect and abuse, leading to a life of prostitution. XXXXX was a huge star at the time and considered one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood. Here her look isn't glamorous, it's tortured. Her body posture nearly doubles over in agony. She scrunches her face to become a pathetic creature on the screen. XXXXX conveys these angst-ridden feelings to the viewer to convince us of her misery.<br /><br />This is dark subject matter and XXXXX brings it to life. It’s not light fare, not fun, not for everyone. ‘XXXX Christie’ is strong emotions dredged up from the depths for examination, this is one helluva ride.
