This film was a new direction for XXXXXXX XXXXXXX. A much more adult role, though she comes to it from the traces of a child in the movie itself. XXX,(XXXXXXX) and XXXXX XXXXXXXX, who plays her newly divorced mother, XXXXX, travel from a small town in the middle of nowhere to XXXXXXX XXXXX. There these tortured souls try to come to terms with their new life and their new relationship as XXXXXXX's character grows up. Unknowingly at first to XXXXX, she grows up and becomes a better mother for it.<br /><br />XXX sees her mother telling her she wants to be an actress, or so she thinks. XXXXX uses that crutch every time there are problems in their lives. We see their struggle as mother and daughter come to terms between themselves and with being alone, having left their old lives behind.<br /><br />The acting is top notch from both of them. They seemingly become mother and daughter before your eyes. You can almost feel there is a bond there beyond the actual movie.<br /><br />Though this movie really doesn't take us to any new ground in these types of films, the fact that the acting is well done, and the story isn't too flawed, let's me recommend it.<br /><br />I will say however, it will probably go away soon, I don't believe it can have the staying power needed for a huge Christmas season of movies starting in a week or so. See it now before this happens if you like either of these actresses.
