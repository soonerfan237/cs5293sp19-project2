It's hard to believe that there are some people out there in the world that actually think this is a worthy XXXXXXX Bronson vehicle. <br /><br />XXXXXXX is a good actor that can do more than tote a gun and knock off bad guys. He was quietly moving in the TV movie "Yes Virginia, There is a Santa Claus" and showed a lot of class and style in the Sean Penn-directed "The Indian Runner".<br /><br />In "The Evil That XXX Do", however, Bronson again plays a character that sees injustice and sets it right with fists, knives and, of course, guns. There's nothing here you haven't seen in the last five "XXXXX Wish" flicks. <br /><br />Wait, I take that back. This has to be the most sadistic and repellently violent film XXXXXXX has ever had the dis-service of being in. Not just repellent in the scenes of torture or the descriptions of torture, but in the fact that these scenes were put in a film just to sell tickets. And XXXX Ferrer! What in blue blazes was he doing here?!! I mean, he won an Oscar, for crying out loud!!! <br /><br />Okay, sorry about that outburst. Let me just say that "The Evil That XXX Do" has to be one of the worst movies I had ever seen that was based on a book. Yeah, that's right. I wonder if it was written with XXXXXXX in mind?<br /><br />No stars. Watch "XXXXX Wish" instead. At least IT was topical.
