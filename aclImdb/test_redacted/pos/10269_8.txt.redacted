One year after 'Love Thy Neighbour' made its I.T.V. debut, it followed the route taken by 'On The Buses' and 'Steptoe & XXX' by graduating onto the big screen, in a picture made by Hammer Films. It opens with a stirring patriotic speech lauding the virtues of England's green and pleasant land, then cuts to a shot of XXXXX and XXXX walking up a street, arguing furiously. This escalates into a strange sequence of white and black neighbours vandalising their each other's homes. At least the original theme tune is retained ( even if it is sung by someone other than XXXXXX XXXXXXX ).<br /><br />The local paper - 'The XXXXXXX' - is holding a contest to find the best neighbours, the winners landing a Mediterranean cruise. Barbie suggests to XXXX that they should enter. The thing is, can XXXX and XXXXX stay friends long enough to win it? That's the main part of the plot. The film is by and large episodic. One chunk is lifted directly from Season 1, namely XXXX and XXXXX going to the Club pretending to be on 'union business'. In reality they're going to see a stripper ( not meeting two girls ). Another portion of the movie has XXXX, along with other black factory workers ( in the series he was the only one ), breaking a strike XXXXX has helped bring about by various ploys ( including being smuggled in through the gates in beer barrels ). While another ( seemingly inspired by Powell and XXXXXX's 'For The Love Of Ada' ) sees XXXXX's talkative mother ( the magnificent XXXXXXXX XXXXX ) getting friendly with XXXX's father ( XXXXXXX XXXXX ).<br /><br />The climax to Episode 1 Season 1 reappears in an expanded form. XXXX once more puts on paint and a towel to terrify XXXXX, but his friends join him, and they dance round a drum containing a naked Booth, so that they can pretend to cook and eat him. XXXXX then has to make his way home in the nude ( surprisingly, there is less nudity here than there was in Episode 2 Season 2 ).<br /><br />The film ends with the Reynolds and the Booths winning the 'Love Thy Neighbour' contest, and taking the cruise together, but there's an unexpected twist involving XXXX's sex-mad brother Cyril ( XXXXX XXXX - 'Private XXXXXX' of 'Dad's Army' ), who is working as a steward.<br /><br />This is your typical '70's sitcom-into-movie, with all the faults usually prevalent in such films. The laughs are scattered about, and interest wanes after about half an hour. The cast is augmented by familiar faces such as XXXXXX XXXXX ( cast as XXXXXX', a character from Episode 2 Season 1, played on that occasion by XXXXXX XXXXXXX ), XXXX Fraser ( as the factory manager ), XXXX XXXXXX, XXXXXX XXXXXXXX ( who seems to have been in every '70's British comedy film, mostly cast as nymphomaniacs ), and XXXXXX XXXXXXX. The director, XXXX XXXXXX, was also responsible for the 'Man About The House' movie.<br /><br />Funniest moment - while XXXXX sleeps in a quiet part of the factory, XXXX paints his face black. The first he knows of it is when the manager's secretary screams in terror. The tables have been turned!
