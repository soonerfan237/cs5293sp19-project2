"Father Hood" is an overlooked little gem of a "road movie". Fine performances by XXXXX XXXXX, XXXXXX XXXXX and XXXXX XXXXXXX, two really fun "over-the-top" ones by XXXXX XXXX and XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX,<br /><br />and a downright outstanding one from XXXXXXX XXXXXX. The movie is helped by an unconventional storyline, but badly undercut by it's flashback framing which results in a formulamatic, abrupt ending. "Father Hood" would have worked MUCH better without these "bookends". Nevertheless, the movie brings up important issues of "family responsibilities" and the consequences of state intervention. As long as the foster system rewards state institutions for NOT placing children, such abuses will exist.<br /><br />Pick this one up. It's worth the "ride."
