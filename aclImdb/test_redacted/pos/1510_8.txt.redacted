Un Gatto nel XXXXXXXX, or Nightmare Concert as it's more commonly know amongst English speaking audiences, starts as horror film director XXXXX XXXXX (played by the man himself XXXXX XXXXX) goes to lunch after filming a very gory & violent scene, however he orders steak & has a horrible vision relating to cannibalism. The grotesque visions, hallucinations & dreams continue & begin to affect his mental state, XXXXX decides to seek help & contacts Professor Egon XXXXXXX (XXXX XX XXXXXXXX) for psychiatric help. XXXXXXX claims that XXXXX cannot separate fantasy from reality & agrees to help him, however XXXXXXX has a more sinister ulterior motive as a serial killer starts to brutally kill prostitutes & XXXXX thinks he might be responsible....<br /><br />This Italian production was co-written & directed by XXXXX XXXXX who also stars in the film as a horror film director named XXXXX XXXXX which doesn't really feel like a lot of effort went into it, anyway Un Gatto nel XXXXXXXX is gory if nothing else & for that alone I rather liked it. The script by XXXXX, XXXX XXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX & XXXXXXX XXXXXXX is nothing more than a threadbare excuse to edit together lots of gory footage from other Italian films. It serves it's purpose well enough I suppose & to see XXXXX on screen has a certain fascination if your a fan of his or are familiar with his films, the ending is very rushed almost as if they ran out of money as it just has a policeman telling XXXXX they killed the killer & that's it. Another thing about that ending when the two cops put the white sheet over the dead killer in the field & then they walk away leaving it there without any other police presence, I mean would the police in Italy just leave a dead body in the middle of a field on it's own? It moves along at a good pace & if you like your gore then you have to see this although if you don't like gore then you'll hate it with a passion, it all depends on your disposition so the choice folks is yours.<br /><br />Director XXXXX was never the most artistically adept filmmaker & it shows here as his footage is bland, flat & looks like it was shot for TV, the footage from the other films (7 in total) doesn't match the stuff XXXXX shot & it is obvious that this has been pieced together from different films. If your looking for gore you've hit the jackpot, people are dismembered with chainsaws, put through meat grinders, faces are melted, there are a few decapitations, there are some slit throats, someones body is gorily crushed under a car, a tongue is ripped out, someone has their throat crushed as a wheelchair runs over it, there are loads of stabbings, someone has their guts removed with a hook, there's a rotten corpse complete with maggots, someone hand is cut off, someone has their head bashed in & their eye falls out, a gory death by piano wire as it slices through someones throat, there are loads of severed limbs, gallons of blood splashed around & a scene of some cats eating brains & there's more as well. Having said that some of the special effects are a bit fake & look cheesy.<br /><br />With a supposed budget of around $100,000 it shows, this is pretty cheap looking, it has no visual style or artistic merit but then again why would you want those when you can see a Nazi orgy sequence & wall-to-wall gore? The acting in this is terrible including XXXXX.<br /><br />Un Gatto nel XXXXXXXX is a top film if your a gore-hound like me, however if your looking for something with a little bit more substance or indeed any substance then this ones not for you. This is the sort of film which divides people straight down the middle, you'll either love what it does or hate it.
