As i watched "XXXXX XXXXXXXX" i couldnt but laugh at what was taking place on screen. XXXXX sure got a lot of play from both boys and women but i was confused as to why the actor that played XXXXX in H.S. was 10 years old. Then the actor changed age to like 20 to play XXXXX when he was a senior in HS...but whatever, i thought it was funny.
