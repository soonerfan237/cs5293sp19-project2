If you have ever shopped at Wal-Mart, then you probably know about the $5 DVD bin that sits by the electronics department. Well, that is where I found this movie. However, I was tricked! You see, the cover of this particular DVD had a big picture of XXXXX Bullock on it and even listed her name as a "headliner". I picked it up thinking, "Wow, I didn't know XXXXXX Bullock did this movie?!?!" So I was pumped to go home and watch a cool XXXXXX Bullock movie. Much to my surprise, Ms. XXXXXXX had a small role.....very small role. She plays the girlfriend of the son of the CIA agent. Talk about supporting actress. She may have had no more than 2 lines in the movie. Besides being deceived of this being a Bullock flick, I looked past that and I continued to watch an "action-packed" film. Negative! At one point, for special effects, a gun was taped to the camera. You gotta watch it to laugh at what horrible really is.
