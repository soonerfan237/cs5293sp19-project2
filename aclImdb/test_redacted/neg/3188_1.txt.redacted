Horrendous "comedy" in which a beautiful, crazy woman (XXX Tyler) "comedically" destroys the lives of three men (Matt Dillon, Paul Reiser and John Goodman). Dillon hires a hit man (XXXXXXX Douglas) to kill her. What is happening to comedy? The year 2001 has produced some of the worst comedies ever (Saving XXXXXXXXX, Sugar and Spice, Freddy Got Fingered, Tomcats, etc etc). This is one of the worst. There's not one, repeat, not ONE funny moment in it. The jokes are either stupid, unfunny, smutty or real sick. Also there's a strong hatred of women in this garbage--the only main female character (XXXXX) is constantly used as a sex object. Also extreme, bloody violence is thrown in at the end. The only bearable moments come from XXXX McEntire as a psychiatrist and Andrew Dice Clay in two roles--both psychos. Dillon, XXXXXXX and Reiser have hit an all-time career low with this--the only way to go is up. And poor XXXXX! She quit doing intelligent, gutsy independent films for THIS? And DOUGLAS???? What was he on when he agreed to this? An utter piece of crap--to be avoided AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!!
