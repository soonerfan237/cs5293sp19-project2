Wales seems to be turning out some quirky movies recently. Actually, XXXXX seems to be developing its own little film industry. I recently saw XXXX Annie Mary, which I thought was very good. But XXXXX with a View is not only quirky, it's laugh out loud funny, has a cast of wonderfully talented actors (Brenda Blethyn is amazing), and a plot that, while not entirely original, is so cleverly written that one is always gleefully picking up what might almost be throwaway lines. It was the kind of movie that I wanted to watch again immediately it was over, and one of very few that I would actually like to own. Even though many of the characters are caricatures, and you have to have been to a Welsh village to appreciate that, they are also very human, and the rapport between XXXXXXX and Molina is a joy to behold.
