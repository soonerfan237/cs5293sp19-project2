Affable aspiring cartoonist XXXXX XXXXXX (a wonderfully engaging performance by XXXX XXXXXX) and his best buddy XXXXXX (the deliciously deadpan XXXX XXXXXX) go to Nantucket for the summer following graduation from high school. Hoops, XXXXXX, and several newfound pals come to the aid of Cassandra (Demi Moore at her most charming), a singer who's family house is being threatened with demolition by the greedy Beckersted clan. Writer/director Savage XXXXX XXXXXXX offers an often hilariously wacky and zesty nonstop barrage of admittedly broad and dumb, but still very funny jokes. The constant madcap lunacy has a real giddy, good-natured and infectiously inane vitality to it that's impossible to either dislike or resist. Moreover, the lively and enthusiastic acting from a fine game cast adds immensely to the zany merriment: XXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX as the spastic Egg Stork, XXX XXXXXXX as his goofy brother XXXX, XXXXXX XXXXXXXXX as the sweet Ack Ack Raymond, XXXX XXXXXXX as evil rich jerk XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX, XXXX XXXXXXX as the mean XXXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXXXX as the fetching XXXXXX, XXX XXXXXXXX as the gung-ho General Raymond, XXXXXXX XXXXXX as cranky XXX XXX XXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXX XXXXX as smug preppy bully Ty, and XXXX XXXXXXXX as hulking biker Stan. XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX's slick cinematography, the hip thrashy soundtrack, XXXX XXXXXX' cool rockin' score, and the funky animation are all uniformly excellent. Single funniest scene: Egg in a Godzilla suit terrorizing a posh dinner party. An absolute hoot.
