Okay, when it comes to plots, this film is far from believable and also a bit silly. Yet despite its many deficiencies, the film manages to work--provided you turn off your brain and just let yourself enjoy the zaniness of it all. If you can't, then you probably won't like this film very much at all.<br /><br />In one of the oddest plots of the 1930s, XXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX plays a guy living near the Arctic Circle at a wireless station. How exactly he came to such a remote outpost is uncertain but into this very, very lonely and isolated existence come a steady string of guests--even though it had been years since he'd seen anyone but Eskimos.<br /><br />First, XXXXXXXX XXXX and XXXXX XXX arrive when their plane crashes. They are supposedly on their way to Montreal--how they got THAT far off course is beyond belief! Reginald is a stuffy and dull fellow who is really worried about XXXXXXXXXX, since XXXXXX hasn't seen a woman in a very long time and XXXX seems in constant dread that XXXXXXXXXX is out to steal XXX for himself. As for XXXXXXXXXX, that's EXACTLY what his plans are! For the longest time, you never really understand why XXX is engaged to XXXX--since he is about as appealing as soggy bread.<br /><br />Soon, XXX and XXXXXXXXXX fall in love but this is all for naught when, out of the blue AGAIN, XXXXXXXXXX's old fiancée arrives to announce she's there to marry him!! Considering that for over two years she never wrote and refused to follow him, XXXXXXXXXX naturally assumed the relationship was over--but the chipper and annoying fiancée's sudden arrival is enough to destroy the plans XXX and XXXXXXXXXX were making.<br /><br />How all this is resolved is something you can just see for yourself. As for the film, that the plot is very silly and contrived--I can't defend this. BUT, it also is pretty funny and charming and I see this film as a kooky comedy that is just a step or two below contemporary films like BRINGING UP BABY. Silly, slight but also very charming. It's worth seeing despite not being especially believable.
