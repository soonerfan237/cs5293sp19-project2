XXXXXX was great as julie, and XXX was once again magnificent as XXX XXXXXX, but there should have been more references towards the other three movies! I mean, come on! First off, XXXXX's XXXXXX!? XXXXXX makes a very brief mention of him and that's it. XXXXXX was his best friend and should've at least made an appearance in the movie. He could've helped XXXXXX train Julie-San! On the flip side, the music stayed true to the movie though, with a little more instrumentation(Fretless Bass)to accompany the wonderfully played Pan-Flute! It doesn't feel like a Karate Kid movie unless you hear that Pan-Flute! Thank you Zamfir! Overall, a decent movie though! We miss you Noriyuki!
