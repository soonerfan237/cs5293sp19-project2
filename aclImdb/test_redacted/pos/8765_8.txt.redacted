Saboteur is a 1942 film, partly aimed at getting American support for the war against Nazi Germany. Propaganda or not, it's great entertainment. The leading actors are XXXXXX XXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXX Lane, although director XXXXXX XXXXXXXXX wanted XXXX XXXXXX, and XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX in the roles, which would have given the movie more stature. This is a good movie anyway with XXXXXX XXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXX Lane bringing their own style to the characters. As in other XXXXXXXXX movies, we see the director's disregard for the socially suave and the well-heeled. He often portrayed spies and foreign agents as nice upper-class folk who at the same time sneered at democratic values and concepts such as guilty until proved innocent. These upper crust traitors are the last the police pursue or even suspect. XXXXXXXXX had a lifelong distrust of the police. He wanted to elevate the regular guy, the bungler and the fellow who doesn't take himself too seriously. One can see him wanting XXXX XXXXXX as an icon in the Frank Capra mold. Nevertheless, XXX XXXXXXXX puts his own stamp on the boy-next-door and works well in the role. XXXXXXXXX Lane, as the spunky female lead, comes off as the all-American girl who can handle herself quite nicely when put to the test. XXXXXX XXXXXXXX, as defence plant worker XXXXX XXXX, is framed for a bombing that kills his best friend. This leads to a cross-country chase scene reminiscent of other XXXXXXXXX heroes on the run. XXXXXXXXX repeats some of the well-established formulas from previous films - the reluctant female who is drawn into the action, e.g. XXXXXXXXX Carroll in the 39 Steps, and risking his life to evade the authorities who are on his heels. We view scenes of America as XXXX tries to find the real culprit in the bombing he stands accused of. We see rivers, bridges, backwoods cabins, truckers, the Hoover Dam and finally, New York City. New York is a fitting backdrop for the climax as we go from XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXX to the ocean liners (with a cut to the ship Normandy) and the grand finale on the Statue of Liberty. Great movie with uninterrupted action. Don't miss it.
