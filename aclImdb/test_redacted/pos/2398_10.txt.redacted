I just viewed XXXXX Monroe and I was very impressed. The story was easily paced as the plot unraveled to a surprise ending. Heartwarming performances, action, humor, and drama filled the screen. Topnotch acting by some talented Long Islanders. Great script. This is the best film that XXXX Carpenter has made to date, he should be very proud of this work. XXXX Brown's score is on the mark. XXXXX Morris is the next Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt. XXXX to believe this is a low budget, independent film. Just imagine what XXXXXXXXX can do with a Hollywood level budget. XXXX Regina's last film and he is greatly missed and loved by all. He was a wonderful, successful, talented actor and a great human being. He will watch over us all and we will never forget his dynamic smile and spirit. Great job to all who participated in this film. A few cherished scene stealing, and humorous cameos to break up the serious content. You will enjoy this film, go see it!
