First off let me say, If you haven't enjoyed a Van Damme movie since bloodsport, you probably will not like this movie. Most of these movies may not have the best plots or best actors but I enjoy these kinds of movies for what they are. This movie is much better than any of the movies the other action guys (Segal and Dolph) have thought about putting out the past few years. XXX Damme is good in the movie, the movie is only worth watching to XXX Damme fans. It is not as good as Wake of Death (which i highly recommend to anyone of likes XXX Damme) or In hell but, in my opinion it's worth watching. It has the same type of feel to it as XXXXXXX to Run. Good fun stuff!
