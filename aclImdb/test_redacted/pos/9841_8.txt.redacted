Remember - before there was XXXXXX, there was Dudley.<br /><br />XXXXXX XXXXXX is barely recalled today - because his heyday as a fixture in sound movies was the late 1920s and through the 1930s. Except for one major performance: the ship's good natured, if tipsy doctor in the 1935 MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY, most of his films are barely revived. More's the pity because he was a wonderful actor. In 1931 he played XXXXXX XXXXXX (the original actor to play that villain) opposite XXXXXXX XXXXXX's XXX XXXXX in the first THE MALTESE FALCON. Similarly, about the same time, he played the recording angel in Leslie XXXXXX's version of OUTWARD BOUND - the same role that XXXXXX Greenstreet tackled in BETWEEN TWO WORLDS a decade later.<br /><br />XXXXXX could be likable and lovable (that ship's doctor again), or detestable (in CHINA SEAS, as the judgmental XXXXX XXXX sneering at poor XXXXX XXXXX but then proving he's as big a coward in a moment of crisis). He held his own against XXXX XXXXXXX in THE EMPEROR JONES. He is the Chinese freedom fighter working with XXXX XXXXXX in THE GENERAL DIED AT DAWN. XXXXXX could do anything. <br /><br />Here, he is XXX XXXXXXXX, the hypocritical and thieving warden of a reform school that XXXXXXX XXXXX and his friends are sent to for committing a robbery and injuring a Greek-American store owner (it is the latest incident for most of them). XXXXXX is as bad here as in CHINA SEAS, but it is a close thing to totally dislike him. He's able to somehow transcend his roles...more later about that.<br /><br />XXXXX has a gang of urban delinquents (including a Jewish boy and "Farina" from "OUR GANG"). As pointed out in another review, it is a prototype of the Bowery Boys. We see them shake down car owners to pay them to "watch and protect" their autos. When one guy won't do it, they calmly wreck his car. The snatch and grab robbery at the store of the Greek-American is also rather graphically shown - his skull getting fractured when pushed. <br /><br />The boys are rounded up and brought before stern but decent judge XXXXXX XXXXX, who realizes that he can't leave the kids with their parents: the parents are unable to watch them, or are incompetent. Unfortunately there are three racial stereotypes in this sequence: a Jewish father who is more concerned with his business than with his son, Farina's stereotype "Yassum" father, and the an Italian father whose willingness to cooperate gets his son out of going to the reform school.<br /><br />Once there the boys find the regime oppressive. Occasionally one of the guards or the nurse (XXXXX XXXXX) tries to speak up for them. But XXXXXX has no time for coddling. His is a regime determined to break the boys so they behave themselves. Unfortunately, XXXXXX and his bookkeeper partner are greedy. They have been serving inferior food to the boys and pocketing the profit. <br /><br />One day a new official comes from the state to look at the reform school. It's XXXXX XXXXXX, who is a hack ward heeler whose gang got the vote out for XXXXXX XXXXXXX. As a reward (he could not get the Park Commissioner post) XXXXXX was made an Assistant school inspector. He is supported by his hanger-on pal and factotum XXXXX XXXXXXX (in his first XXXXXX XXXXXXX film). <br /><br />The irony is that if XXXXXX were a bit more careful, XXXXXX would probably have let him continue running things. But XXXXXX arrives to see XXXXX brought to XXXXXX for fighting. The Warden and XXXXXw have had problems about respect earlier, and XXXXXX now intends to punish XXXXX who flees - but get seriously injured by XXXXXX' barbed wire fences and his free use of a whip. XXXXXX stops XXXXXX and lets Evans treat XXXXX's injuries. And she explains the reality of the situation to XXXXXX, and her own idea of real reformatory reform of the boys by building up trust in them with responsibility.<br /><br />The film follows this to the end, showing that XXXXXX and Evans are on the right path, turning the reformatory as a "republic" for the boys to run properly. This leads to conflict with XXXXXX, whose profiteering is reduced as he is no longer getting supplies. But the scheme is derailed when XXXXXX himself finds he may be in serious trouble with the law. XXXXXX sees his opportunity and fully takes it. But then he goes too far...far more than he ever bargained for.<br /><br />The 1930s had many films showing kids taking steps to right wrongs and change things. XXXXX appeared in such as WILD BOYS OF THE ROAD. XXXXX B. XX XXXXX did THIS DAY AND AGE, where the kids teach a lesson to a gangster played by XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX that scares the hell out of him. So it went in the 1930s. THE MAYOR OF HELL reaches a similar intensity of vengeance and juvenile justice seeking. But that's the one problem of the film. XXXXXX' character is a knave and hypocrite, so we never really cheer for him, yet if he wasn't a thief we might go along with his view (even if it is counter-productive). The scenes at the start of XXXXX and his gang preying on people actually make the harshness XXXXXX would follow seem fairly understandable (even if his thieving ways are not). Also he has one moment when he's justifiably angry at XXXXXX - at that point in hiding from his own clash with the law - giving orders over a phone from long distance to a befuddled XXXXXX. When XXXXXX learns what's actually happened he is justifiably furious at XXXXXX lecturing him about proper behavior. It is the closest thing to making XXX XXXXXXXX sympathetic in this fine movie.
