It's along the line of comedy of errors, mistaken affection transferring from one to another, blossoms and passes onkinda cat and mouse situations Flares of passion, sparks of fire fanned and put outguessing maybe she loves, he loves or they love XXXXXX of emotions, evolving, releasinghiding, yet not hidingwanting to let him know, wanting to let her know, let them know XXXX ensemble cast in spite of the seemingly confusing mix of emotions from different parties involved. <br /><br />It's a refreshing charmer, casual, free and easy and rather down to earth -- not XXXXXXXXX glamorous like "Notting XXXX", but lots of human feelings, frailty, vulnerability a-flowing. Yes, all revolving around an accidentally (lost &) found love letter. XXXX XXXXXXX as the owner of the town's bookstore, with a variety of characters portrayed by XXXXX XXXXXXXXX, XXX XXXXXXX, XXXXXX XXXXXX, XXX XXXXXXX XXXXX, XXXXXX XXXXXX, XXXXX XXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXX XXXXXX as the seemingly unaffected Mrs. Scattergoods. Romance is in the air, love lurking everywhere. You get to appreciate the talented XXXX XXXXXXX. ("The Alarmist" is another quirky little movie which is fun to watch: XXXXXXX has a wonderful chemistry with XXXXX XXXXXXXX, and XXXXXXXX with XXXXXXX XXXXX).<br /><br />"Notting XXXX" is satisfying in its story revolving around the glittering pairing of XXXXX XXXXXXX and XXXX XXXXX, and the wonderful support of his circle of (London) friends. "Love Letters" is delightful in its quirky (Loblolly) small town-ness, and its story involving XXXX XXXXXXX's centrifuged ripple effects on her friends and neighbors. Both maybe fantasies, somehow, the latter felt more attainable if it should happen to you. And if you appreciate words or poetic lines, it could be the movie for you.
