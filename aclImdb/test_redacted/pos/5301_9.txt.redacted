While XXXXX Miyazaki's movies have always been hit-or-miss with me with regards to story, they are unequivocally gorgeous to the eye, with characters of simple animation against a backdrop of artistic images. Ponyo sticks to that formula, with a lead character so adorable I want a plush doll of her and scenery so pretty it wouldn't look out of place framed up as a picture on a wall.<br /><br />The story, on the other hand, I didn't enjoy quite as much as his last two wide-releases, Spirited XXXX and Howl's Moving Castle. It was just a tad too juvenile, coming across as more for kids and leaving adults to just enjoy the animation.<br /><br />I was also disappointed that the score done by XXX Hisaishi, who also the scores for the above-mentioned two movies, wasn't nearly as memorable this time around. While I can't quite recall XXXX's score now, I still remember it being one of the most beautiful I had ever heard. XXXXX Spirited's - though I only remember it being very complementary to the movie. Maybe it's because XXXXX is more juvenile fare that the score isn't quite as haunting. In any case, this movie is still a must-watch for fans of anime or XXXXXXXX.
