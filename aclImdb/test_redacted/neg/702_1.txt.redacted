This is one of the worst films i've ever seen, don't watch it even if your life depends on it.<br /><br />This Laurel and XXXXX film is when they inherit an island, become shipwrecked and are set to be hung. An incredibly boring film that is no where near funny.<br /><br />This was the last Laurel and XXXXX film and what a very low note to end such a superb career. The 40's films weren't great, this film was made in 1950. If you want to remember XXXXXX and Hardy, remember them in their prime, the 1930's. The short talking films are better than the feature length films, my favourite is "Me and My Pal". Another reason this film is awful is because it's dubbed. The actor opens there mouth and the words come out three days later. Absoulutley crap, but let's end on a high note, XXXXXX and Hardy have been, in my opinion, the best double act ever.
