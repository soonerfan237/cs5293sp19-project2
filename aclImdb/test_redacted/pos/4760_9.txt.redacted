He plays straight but with a quiet intensity that makes him one of the top cops in movie history. XXX XXXXXXXX stars in a poor man's French Connection that has a little of the same gritty appeal. FC is a better movie, but I prefer watching this one because 1) I think XXXXXXXX is great and this is his best movie, and 2) this has the best car chase EVER, one that makes XXXXXXX look like a cable production (thanks again to XXXX XXXXXXX, who actually plays the driver). It doesn't hurt that XXXX XXXXXXXX stops by (again) to play a baddie. Please enjoy.
