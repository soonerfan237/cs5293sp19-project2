Set just before the Second World War, this is a touching and understated romantic story that is loosely based on a real event.<br /><br />It concerns a German rocket scientist XXXXXXX XXXXXX (XXXXXX XXXXXXX) working in Britain in the advent of the Second World War. Fearing XXXXXX may recall him to Germany to assist him preparing for war, XXXXXX and his slippery assistant Heinz (XXXXX XXXXXX) are evacuated by the British authorities to a remote Scottish island. They are given the task of building a rocket post box that will enable the islanders to communicate with the mainland.<br /><br />Mocked and bullied by the islanders, they set up home with local girl XXXXXXXXX XXXXXX (the stunning XXXXXX XXXXXXXXX), with whom XXXXXXX begins an affair but complications arise when Germany comes calling...<br /><br />The central romance between XXXXXX and Catherine is subtle and sincerely played and the supporting cast is a colourful bunch with an array of respected Scottish character actors including XXXX XXXXX and XXXXX Russell.<br /><br />Fine cinematography and a brilliant central theme song sung in the local dialect round out this movie.<br /><br />Intelligent but undemanding, it is good for a quiet evening in.
