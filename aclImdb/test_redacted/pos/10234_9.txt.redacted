Adapting his own novel "Cabal" for the screen, author / screenwriter / director XXXXX XXXXXX fashioned this marvelous story of outr√© horror and fantasy. XXXXX Sheffer plays XXXXX, a young man who becomes suspected of being a serial killer. The cops gun him down in front of Midian, on the surface a cemetery but which is actually a haven for monsters that have been shunned by society. When they lay claim to XXXXX and make him one of their own, this causes repercussions for everybody, including XXXXX's sweet girlfriend (the very cute XXXX XXXXX) and dubious psychiatrist (a most enjoyable XXXXX XXXXXXXXXX).<br /><br />"Nightbreed" displays the kind of wild and twisted imagination that I don't see in movies all that often. For one thing, XXXXX XXXXXXXXX, an old hand at conceptual art having worked on such films as the initial three "XXXX XXXX" entries, helps XXXXXX to create excellent visuals for "Nightbreed", starting right away with the opening credit sequence. The visual and makeup effects are elaborate, and production design and cinematography quite impressive. XXXXXX and crew do a wonderful job at creating this whole other world with compelling characters. It's colorful and flamboyant entertainment and is a pleasure to take in. And of course there's the strong sense of social commentary regarding intolerance and bigotry, not to mention the heavy consequences that can result from a person's actions.<br /><br />Great supporting performances add to the fun. Cronenberg oozes lots of malevolent intent and is a real gas as the bad doctor, while XXXXXXX XXXX is a fine love-to-hate-him type of antagonist, a rather nasty police captain. Doug "Pinhead" XXXXXXX once again gets buried under heavy makeup as the weary Lylesberg, and is solid as a rock. XXXX XXXX is great fun as Narcisse, as is XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX as Rachel (as an added bonus, she bares her breasts in one sequence). XXXXX Bamford, who played the "Butterball Cenobite" in the first two "Hellraiser" pictures, turns up here as well. There's even a cool cameo by 50's and 60's sci-fi star XXXX Agar.<br /><br />XXXXX XXXXXX supplies another of his fantastic scores, and XXXXXX leads us steadily through the intriguing story towards a terrific apocalyptic showdown.<br /><br />"Nightbreed" is an excellent genre film worth checking out for anybody who hasn't seen it. I give it a hearty recommendation.<br /><br />9/10
