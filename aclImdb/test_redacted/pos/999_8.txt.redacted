From the start of "The Edge Of Love", the viewer is transported to the striking world of WW2 London. We follow the lives of four people who might have been created just for this movie, an exploration of female friendship and the strains caused on it by marriage and infidelity. Except one of the characters is named XXXXX Thomas, perhaps the greatest English poet of the 20th century. And his reactions to the world around him were not only selfish, but at times truly despicable. <br /><br />This movie is based on XXXXXX' writings about love and romance. These were adapted with a sharp screenplay by XXXXXXX MacDonald (Keira Knightley's mother). The director, XXXX Maybury, does claim that the three other lead characters were actual people. <br /><br />All four are performed very strongly. XXXXXX Miller is Dylan's wife, Keira Knightley is the cabaret singer Vera Phillips. XXXXXXX Rhys is Dylan Thomas, and Cillian Murphy is William Killick. The first section of the movie takes place in London during the Nazi air raids, with XXXX being pursued by Willaim, a soldier waiting for deployment. By a chance encounter, XXXXX meets with his first love, Vera. From there Vera meets XXXXXXX, Dylan's wife. While the three are drinking, XXXXXXX successfully breaks Vera's guard. <br /><br />The film follows their lives as XXXX and William are married and he is sent to war. Vera has become pregnant, and returns to XXXXX with Dylan and Caitlin. There they face a gritty existence, with XXXX supporting Dylan and Caitlin with her husband's war pay. Through these times, XXXX's and Caitlin's friendship grows. So does XXXXX's infatuation with Vera. She gives in. This creates the first test for the two women. <br /><br />When XXXXXXX returns from war, he barely recognizes his wife, and has no bond with his infant son. Things get worse, as XXXXX idly watches his friend struggle with battleground fatigue (post traumatic stress disorder). XXXXXXX realizes something has happened between Dylan and Vera, and in a drunken rage shoots up Dylan's house.<br /><br />"Edge Of Love" starts as a stylish romance in war torn London and ends in the stark, gritty life of motherhood, infidelity, and attempted murder in Wales. The treatment of PTSD is well done, and should speak to an American audience. Some day (see ending).<br /><br />Each star has a great moment. XXXXXX when she is yanking out stitches in her head in response to her abortion of another man's child. Knightley and XXXXX when he finally bonds with his son. Oh hell, almost all their scenes are awesome. And XXXX when he purgers himself on the stand to get Vera's husband sent to jail. <br /><br />Yet, the real star of the movie is XXXXXXXX Freeman's cinematography and John Maybury's direction. They seem to understand that no matter how good the story or how historical XXXXXX is, this is a film dominated by two great actresses of our time. And they cherish their scenes with stunning shots. While this isn't best picture material, it is a very good movie (much more engaging than "The Dutchess"). It has a visual lyricism that accentuates the use of XXXXXX' poetry. Also, this is clearly XXXXXXXXX's second best performance of her career, and perhaps Miller's best. <br /><br />I have always had a weakness for the Artist in struggle, whether it's XXXXX's Mozart, or Hoffman's Capote. But I was stunned at how little sympathy I felt for XXXXX Thomas. His struggles with alcohol are well known. But his antagonism of XXXXXXX and Caitlin to gain possession of his first love Vera makes him out to be.....a bad man.<br /><br />So is this Academy Award Worthy? Clearly no. At least, not this year. It will be released state side in March, 2009, making it ineligible for the Academies. This is 9 months after it was released in Britain. XXXXXXX Atonement, Miss Pettigrew, and Brideshead Revisited, the US has had its fill of WW2 British period pieces. Too bad. This film is better then the other ones, except Atonement. But in this one, XXXXXXXXX's soldier does come back, but as a shell of the man who left her.
