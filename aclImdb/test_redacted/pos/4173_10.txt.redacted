There are two ways to regard 'Head'. Either it is a dazzling, mind-blowing collage of music, old film clips, psychedelia and T.V. sitcom-style comedy, or a plot less, pretentious, rambling mess. The truth probably lies somewhere in between. It is also one of the best movies of all time.<br /><br />'The XXXXXXX' - XXXX XXXXX, XXXXX XXXX, XXXXXX XXXXXX, and XXXX XXXXXXX - had just finished their hit series, and wanted to do a movie. In collaboration with writer XXXX XXXXXXXXX and director XXX XXXXXXXX, they made 'Head'.<br /><br />It begins at a bridge opening ceremony in San Francisco, where the XXXXXXX gate crash the proceedings. Mickey jumps over the safety rail, plunging hundreds of feet into the water. Mermaids rescue him to the accompaniment of a gorgeous XXXXX XXXXXX & XXXXXX XXXX composition called 'The Porpoise XXXX' and visuals that make the Stargate finale of '2001' look drab by comparison. By now you will either have switched off in puzzled disgust or be completely captivated.<br /><br />More bizarre happenings unfold; Mickey uses a tank to destroy a Coca-Cola machine in the middle of the desert; the entire Italian Army surrenders to him; the group are hired to play to play the dandruff in Victor XXXXXX's hair for a television commercial; an overweight waitress insults the group, describing them as 'God's gift to the eight year old's'; a surprise birthday party for XXXX goes wrong; the group are sucked into a vacuum cleaner, and to cap it all, are driven away inside a giant glass tank.<br /><br />You will either hate this or love it. I found it a refreshing change from mindless pop musicals of the 'let's do the show right here' variety. The songs are good too; 'Daddy's XXXX' is superbly choreographed by XXXX XXXXX ( later to appear in Rafelson's 'Easy XXXXX' ) and boasts wonderful editing, with XXXX's clothes changing colour at lightning speed. 'As We Go XXXXX' is a lovely XXXXXX & King number whose accompanying images carry a strong environmentalist message.<br /><br />XXXXX XXXXX, XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX are just two of the guest stars to crop up. XXX Victor XXXXXX read the script before agreeing to do this, one wonders? He's hilarious in it though.<br /><br />So mad there just has to be real genius behind it, 'Head' is a little '60's gem and one worth revisiting time and time again. Shame it did not find an audience at the time. If only 'Spiceworld' had been like this!
