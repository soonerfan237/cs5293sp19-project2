Once again XXXX Madden has given us a magnificent film. A simple but beautiful story located in a real paradise and the music can't be better, XXXXXXX Warbeck delights us once more, and good actings but.........why on earth is Penelope Cruz in this film? I asked myself that same question while watching this movie. Of course her greek accent is not believable, she's uncapable of acting decently not even in one scene. Not even at the end she did a good job, after so many events, after years she finally gets to see XXXXXXX again and she couldn't change the same face of stupidy we had to bear during the whole film. Anyway, XXXX was very good in one of his best characters; Hurt also is great in his and the rest of the cast all did a great job, so the final result is a movie that really is worth of watching. This is a beautiful film that not even Mrs. XXXX was able to spoil. So far I think it's XXXXXX best work so no fan will be disappointed.
