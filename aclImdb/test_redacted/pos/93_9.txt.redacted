A boy who adores XXXXXXX Richard of the Montreal Canadiens receives, much to his horror, a Toronto Maple Leafs sweater in the mail. I recently watched this in a class in which few of the students were interested in hockey, but nearly everyone knew about XXXXXXX Richard and the Toronto/Montreal rivalry. Highly entertaining, amusing, and accurate.
