If you put XXXXXXXX aside, this is The Best Comedy ever, no doubt! Just Great!<br /><br />"The King Of Queens" just finished its eighth season of domestic bliss. Set in the working-class suburb of Queens, New York, the show follows XXXX XXXXXXXXX (XXXXX XXXXX), an amiable delivery man, and his wife, spitfire legal secretary XXXXXX XXXXXXXXX (Leah XXXXXX), as they explore the everyday challenges of love, life, family and marriage. <br /><br />XXXX and XXXXXX deal with day-to-day domestic realities that reflect our times and enable us to laugh at ourselves. Their love for each other ultimately carries them through each dilemma they face, whether it's XXXX's fixation with food or XXXXXX's obsession with expensive clothing. <br /><br />XXXX and XXXXXX also have to deal with the third, high-maintenance member of the Heffernan household 足 XXXXXX's twice-widowed father, XXXXXX XXXXXXX (XXXXX XXXXXXX), who lives in their basement. His constant presence and often bizarre behavior add to their daily adventures. XXXX and XXXXXX have stumbled upon an unorthodox solution to reduce their burden and keep XXXXXX happy 足 his regular excursions with gullible dog walker XXXXX (XXXXXX XXXXXXXX). XXXX's friends XXXXXX XXXXXX (XXXXXX XXXXXXXX), XXXXXX XXXXXX (XXXXXX XXXXXX) and cousin XXXXX XXXXXXXXX (XXXX XXXXXXXXX) round out the cast with their "guy" humor and diverse perspectives.<br /><br />In a manner that evokes "The Honeymooners," THE KING OF QUEENS finds inspiration in life's everyday situations. Last season alone saw XXXX "loaning" XXXXXX to a wifeless Deacon for help with Thanksgiving dinner; the Heffernans suffering through the annoyance and financial strain of mold damage to their house; and XXXX and XXXXXX striving to copy a couple whose photos 足 of a more adventurous life than XXXX and XXXXXX's 足 they accidentally took home. We also watched XXXXXX grow jealous of a new dog that XXXXX added to her route, and XXXX finding out that his overprotective parents replaced his childhood dog Rocky three times behind his back. Throughout, the series showcases XXXXX' incredible physical comedy, XXXXXX's hard-edged wit, and XXXXXXX's unique comic presence.<br /><br />You can't... You shoulden't Miss it!
