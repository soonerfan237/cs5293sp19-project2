Pot-seeking pre-teen XXXXXX XXXXXX (as XXX) throws his sister's doll into the river while XXXXXX XXXXXXX (as XXXXXX) howls and smokes a cigarette, after killing XXXXX XXXXX (as Jamie). The doll washes away, but the naked young woman stays by the "XXXXX's Edge", for any passerby to see. Viewing the dead body are a group of twenty-something teenagers, mostly classmates of the naked corpse. Stoners XXXXX XXXXXX (as Matt) and XXXXXXX XXXXXX (as Layne) are found most camera-worthy. The friends wonder what to do about their guilty, beer-guzzling killer friend.<br /><br />Veteran-in-the-cast XXXXXX XXXXXX (as Feck) keeps the youngsters' heads fed. XXX XXXXXX once killed a woman. He lives with one of those life-sized sex dolls, with a mouth apparently ready for action. XXXX Skye Leitch (as Clarissa) is a more living doll, and she is waiting for Reeves to kiss her. Their copulation is notably cross-cut with a flashback to the opening strangulation. An actual teenager, in her first feature role, Ms. Leitch is the daughter of sixties-singer XXXXXXX. Make other quirky connections on your own.<br /><br />You can read a lot into the movie, or not, depending on your mood. Some of the characters' backgrounds may be a little too subtle. Most obviously, the killer teen was teased; note his weight, attitude, and "toilet"-connected nickname. Some of the characters' relationships and motivations are too vaguely defined, but the cast certainly keeps the material interesting; and, director XXX Hunter, photographer XXXXXXXXX XXXXX, and writer XXXX XXXXXXX are obviously skilled.<br /><br />******* XXXXX's Edge (8/27/86) XXX Hunter ~ XXXXX XXXXXX, XXXXXXX XXXXXX, XXXXXX XXXXXX, XXXXXX XXXXXX
