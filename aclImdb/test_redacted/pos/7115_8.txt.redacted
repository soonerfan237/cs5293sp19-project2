This moody, creepy horror flick begins on a castle atop a cliff overlooking the sea, a great setting, as a vampire bat flies in and creeps toward a sleeping doctor (XXXXXX XXXXXXX). The bat changes into a man known as XXXXX XXXXX, in reality XXXXX XXXXXXX (XXXX XXXXXXXXX). He seeks Dr. XXXXXXXX's help to cure him of his vampirism. Eventually the good doctor also wants to help his hunchbacked nurse-assistant (XXXX XXXXX), the Wolf Man (Lon Chaney), and XXXXXXXXXXXX's monster (XXXXX XXXXXXX). But XXXXXXX's trickery contaminates the doctor's blood, and he becomes a Jekyll/Hyde vampire himself. This is somewhat better than the prior year's "House of XXXXXXXXXXXX", being less episodic and more exciting visually. There's a haunting scene where XXXXXXX tries to lure the second nurse (XXXXXX O'Driscoll) into his world, where she is initially playing "XXXXXXXXX XXXXXX" on the piano, which soon gives way to terrifying music. XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXX uses expressionistic shadows and eerie music to frame many sequences, including a wonderful montage sequence that the studio frequently used in their horror features. Two performers are of note: XXXXXXX, with his wonderful voice, is at first sympathetic, then convincingly menacing. XXXXX, her beautiful face in alarming contrast to her twisted body, exhibits great pathos and sympathy. It all ends in a slam-bang climax, typical of 1940s Universal horror, a little abrupt, with footage borrowed from "The Ghost of XXXXXXXXXXXX" (1942). I hope Universal releases it soon on DVD (it was left out of their Double-Feature releases).
