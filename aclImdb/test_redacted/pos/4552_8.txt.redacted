Well, on the day that XXX Schneider plunges himself further into the black hole of notoriously bad movies by starring in the absolutely not-at-all-wanted "Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo" (hmmmm....wasn't there a film called Roadtrip which was followed by a sequel called Eurotrip? And now there's XXXXX Bigalow: Male Gigolo followed by sequel XXXXX Bigalow: European Gigolo.......I smell a pattern. Perhaps soon there will be XXXXXXXXX: European webs are Hotter.....or not) I am writing about this much maligned (at time of release) film. I was one of those maligners, I must admit. I turned my nose up at it even while XXXXX Farley shoved cocaine up his nose and the SNL cast struggled through one of the worst seasons in their history in '94-'95, the Norm McDonald anchorship notwithstanding. Films like XXXXX Gilmore, Tommy Boy, and Black Sheep came out in the couple years after this period and we realized there was a dark future for the caliber of Spade-Farley-Schneider-Sandler films. However I watched this film the other day, ten years after and 8 years after XXXXX died and could not stop laughing. Yes it's not particularly sophisticated. XXXXXX does what XXXXXX does (not unlike Manny being Manny) but his "Van Down By the River" motivational speaker shtick in which he laments that while he may not "wash enough" or "wear well-fitting clothes" or "use deodorant more than twice a week" translates well here as the ever self-effacing character who realizes he's not the brightest, not the best-looking, and could stand to lose a few pounds. All the same, he's trying his best to do what he's supposed to. And XXXXX Spade just tosses off his snide one-liners as he did for "Spade's Hollywood Minute" and basically stings Farley's self-esteem. There's really not a whole lot more to say than that. I love the one scene when XXXXXX catches Spade spanking his monkey and then makes a couple quips about it. Can't remember what the first one is but the second one, they're lying in their hotel beds and XXXXXX says to Spade, "Do you like baseball?". Spade mutters something inaudible in response and XXXXXXX says, "the New York YANK-ees?" Anyway XXXXXX does his awkward, painfully sensitive, frat-boy shtick. If you like, you like it. I couldn't stop laughing.
