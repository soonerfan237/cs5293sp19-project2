I loved the film "XXXXX Monroe". The film had all the components that kept me interested while watching it. I especially loved the plot twists along the way and the surprising ending. XXXXX Morris has Brad Pitt potential both in looks and talent. His blue eyes reminded me of XXXX Newman's. XXXX Carpenter took this movie to a new level.I loved the cast. The music score, cinematography, talent, locations and script were awesome. I loved seeing some of my favorite actors in Eddie Monroe. XXXX Carpenter is an incredibly talented and gifted director. He gives his work 200%. The film has great texture. I hope that there will be an XXXXX Monroe 2. I would love to see how XXXXXXXXX turns out after getting her windfall of money. XXXX Carpenter's Eddie Monroe is Hollywood level.
