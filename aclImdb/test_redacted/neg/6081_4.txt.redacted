But, since the shot was snapped during a robbery, it makes XXX Hall look like the prime suspect. With pals XXXXX Jordan (as XXXXX), William "Billy" Benedict (as Whitey), and David Gorcey (as Chuck); Mr. Gorcey wants to clear Hall, and collect the $1,000 reward money. "Bowery Bombshell" goes through the motions, with Ms. Loring a main strength.<br /><br />**** Bowery Bombshell (7/20/46) XXXX Karlson ~ Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Teala Loring, Bobby Jordan
