Well...there were some great, creamy-smooth facial shots of XXXXXXX, along with her "shocking", gender-bender outfit (plus her not-to-be-missed "transmogrification" from ape into human being); but, overall, the generally unconvincing plot and dated acting -- not to mention the less than engaging tunes coming from Miss Dietrich's "baritone" voice --did little to ensure Blonde Venus a permanent place in my mind's Pantheon of Memorable Films. Cary Grant -- still in the throes of cinematic infancy -- seemed as though he was forever looking to "find himself", while XXXXXXX Marshall was probably never anything BUT XXXXXXX Marshall from the day he was born, until the day he died. Naturally, from an historical point of view, XXXXXX Venus was fun to watch, so long as one was able to put aside..."great expectations".
