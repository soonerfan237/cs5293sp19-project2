If you want to truly experience the magic (?) of XXX Dohler, then check out "Alien Factor" or maybe "Fiend", but not this. XXXXX Factor is actually rather imaginative considering the low budget and it's fairly creepy, but "Nightbeast", which I guess is sort of an updating of XXXXX Factor, is just plain dumb. Actors sleepwalk through their roles, especially XXX Monotone sheriff, and the monster is some dumb Halloween-mask kind of thing instead of the wildly imaginative (but kind of stupid) looking critters from Alien Factor. A spaceship crashes on XXXXX and there's a critter inside, of course, who runs around vaporizing people. And ripping off arms, etc. And he has a cool ray gun that he uses to vaporize people too, until it gets shot out of his hand. And that's really about it. "Alien Factor" beats this mess hands down, if you really want to see a good XXX Dohler movie, check that out instead. And RIP Don Dohler, 12/2/06.
