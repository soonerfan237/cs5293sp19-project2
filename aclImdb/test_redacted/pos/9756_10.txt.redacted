"The Gay Desperado" is wonderful throughout. The banter between XXX Carrillo and Harold Huber is as funny as anything you would hear in a movie today. Best line? "That would be my third choice!" "Diego" is obviously the archetype for XXXXX Smith's "Silent Bob". XXXXXX N. Andoit's black and white cinematography (particularly with the banditos' shadows) was striking. All I can say about XXX Lupino is, "Thank God for DVD!" You can go right to the scene where she is trying on sombreros and serapes and watch her standing in front of that mirror over and over again.<br /><br />Lest I forget, that XXXX Martini guy sings real purty, too.
