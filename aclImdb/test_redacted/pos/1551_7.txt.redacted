After being off the air for a while, XXXXXXX returned with some new made-for-TV mysteries that, while not being as good as the original series, are better than the shows that were done in the later '90s.<br /><br />"Murder Can Be XXXXXXXXX to Your Health" used the then (and I guess now, if you think about it) true crime shows as the situation for a murder. The murder is committed by a very successful, egomaniacal true crime show host, XXXXXX XXXXXXXX (in a nice bit of casting). His chain-smoking nemesis, who lost the job to him, played by XXXXX XXXXXXX, attempts to blackmail XXXXXXXX when he discovers a porno video XXXXXXXX made with an underage actress in his salad days. XXXXXXXX uses XXXXXXX's cigarettes to deliver the death blow via poison, giving himself an alibi as well.<br /><br />XXXXXXX is brought in to find out what happened. You know the rest. Highly entertaining.
