As a young lass, beautiful XXXX Woodbury (as Rita Adams) was orphaned, after her "stool pigeon" father was shot to death. As a young woman, Ms. XXXXXXXX finds herself struggling to keep a job, as her murdered father's ex-convict status makes XXXXXXXX a bad business risk. Woodbury rooms with understanding songstress XXXXX Ware (as Donna Andrews), who advises Woodbury to get in touch with old orphanage friends John Archer (as Bob Elliott) and Jack La Rue (as Mickey Roman). But, none of her friends can help when XXXXXXXX is the victim of a scam, which lands her in prison. Upon release, Woodbury decides to give the male mobsters a run for their moneyÂ… <br /><br />Re-titled "XXXXX, Inc.", this is an obviously weak, cheap mobster melodrama. Still, it's a lot of fun to watch XXXXXXXX work wonders with inferior material. She plays the innocent growing more sophisticated "Rita" quite convincingly; and, she tosses in a great bit as a blonde hooker. Woodbury must be added to the list of unfortunately underutilized Hollywood actresses of the past. "XXXXX Bullets" also features an early Alan Ladd (as Jimmy Kelly aka Bill Dugan). Ms. Ware, who sang the hit "An Apple for the Teacher" with XXXX Crosby, sings a couple of fair '40s numbers nicely. But, mainly, it's XXXXXXXX's show.<br /><br />**** Paper Bullets (1941) Phil Rosen ~ Joan XXXXXXXX, Linda Ware, Alan Ladd
