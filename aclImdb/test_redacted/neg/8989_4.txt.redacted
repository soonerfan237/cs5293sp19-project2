I read a lot of high hopes from readers of the book that this would be a faithful adaptation of Nora XXXXXXX' story. Not having read the book, I don't know if this adaptation was faithful but I do know it wasn't good. Actually, the screenplay was the best part of the movie so kudos to Nora Roberts.<br /><br />I planned ahead and watched XXXXXXXX Moon because of Claire Forlani. I've never been sure if she's a good actress. She's been decent in some movies, average in others and really bad in this one. But, XXXXXXX wasn't alone. The performances were all over the place. XXXXXX Hudson was wooden and boring. XXXXX Davis was hammy. Then, amidst all this B-rate acting, there's XXXXXXXXXX Bisset! She didn't have a lot to do other than portray bitterness but, even sleepwalking through that, she was miles ahead of the others.<br /><br />Still, XXXXXXX remains one of the most breathtaking women in movies and I was not disappointed in that capacity here. I believe XXXXXXX can be more than eye-candy but, until she turns in a good performance in a good movie, she continues to excel at that. And, I'll continue to faithfully watch everything she participates in. Fandom is fun that way.<br /><br />This movie though, XXXXXXXX Moon, was pretty bad. In addition to the bad acting (fake Southern accents are really distracting) the direction was pedestrian. It wasn't horrible. It was just the boring made-for-TV caliber you're used to seeing on Lifetime.<br /><br />If you're a fan of any of the stars you can probably enjoy XXXXXXXX Moon for that reason, as I did. If you're a fan of the book you might enjoy seeing the story on the screen, albeit in a lackluster form. Otherwise, this movie is unremarkable.
