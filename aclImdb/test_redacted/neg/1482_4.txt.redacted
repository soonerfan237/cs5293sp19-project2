I was Stan in the movie "XXXXXX Come True". Stan was the friend that worked at the factory with the main character and ended getting his arm smashed in the machinery and got carried out screaming (where was the ambulance?) The acting in this movie was for the most part pretty poor with mostly local actors from the XXX Valley, Wisconsin. I saw the movie on the big screen. It played 2 nights in 3 theaters and was something special to see yourself on the big screen. I may be bias, but overall, I enjoyed it. Also the soundtrack was the band XXXXXXX, who later became Garbage. My brother, XXXXX Charlton was also in the movie. He played XXXXXXX the man who comes to the door on crutches to talk with the police.
