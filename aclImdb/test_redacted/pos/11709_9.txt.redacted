Sharky's Machine is easily one of XXXX Reynolds best efforts. It also stands as one of the best contemporary crime dramas. Erotic and violent, the movie distinguishes itself by setting the story in Atlanta, and delivering a chaotic detective case, to you(the viewer), on a silver platter. Dedicated and determined, XXXXXX must stop the murder of Dominoe, a lovely lady of the night, who's clientel is anything but ordinary. Before long, XXXXXX's crimefighting Machine uncovers a conspiracy of the highest order, which threatens to corrupt the inner body of Atlanta. As a resident of Metro Atlanta, I recall the excitement in town during the movie's production. Sharky's Machine goes to great lengths to give an accurate portrayal of Atlanta. Twenty years removed and 2,000,000-more people later, the film stands the test of time. Trust me, XXXXXXX has not changed. One of the highlights of the picture is XXX Robinson's daring stunt(a classic, symbolic ending). It was even featured on That's Incredible, ABC's reality show of the period. It's just too bad that XXXXXXXXX does not make enough films like this one. XXXX back, each your popcorn, and watch sterling silver cinema action.
