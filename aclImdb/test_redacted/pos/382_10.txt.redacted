I have used this movie in my college Ethics courses for over 10 years (also XXXXX XXXXX's "Crimes and Misdemeanors"--another terrific, multi-leveled ethical study). <br /><br />It's fiction. I don't focus too much on the unrealistic features of "Strangers" because all fictional films are obviously false on many levels. I love the film as gallows comedy, tautly told, with many ironic twists and visual pleasures--even if it's "unbelievable." The story is told so well that I don't even think of criticizing its plausibility (although I must confess that the tennis match seems the weakest part to me--too much Hollywood fluff and not enough real tennis competition).<br /><br />Some problems presented in the film that hold promise for realistic moral education and ethical discussion:<br /><br />1. Ethical Passivity: some weaknesses of the XXX character are intended by XXXXXXXXX. A primary ethical insight of the film is the danger of inability to articulate one's moral positions. XXX is unable to effectively block XXXXX's crazy proposals at the start. An interesting question is why and how does XXX behave so passively, ineffectively? A possible answer is his depression because of his intense and complicated divorce process. <br /><br />2. Miscommunication: XXX commits another failure at the start: on the train, to get away quickly, he agrees that XXXXX's ideas are all good. But XXX's literal meaning is opposite to his inflected, sarcastic meaning. XXXXX takes the literal meaning as an agreement for the criss-cross murders. XXX takes the sarcastic meaning as an escape from any murder agreement. To some extent, near the beginning, XXXXX may be partially pretending that an agreement has been struck, to draw XXX further into a web of complicity. XXXXX is manipulating XXX; XXX's linguistic ambiguity on the train gives XXXXX a chance to put an ethical "stranglehold" on XXX. XXXXX manipulating XXX may also take on other meanings . . . .<br /><br />3. Secrecy: Some have speculated about a sexual relationship between XXX and XXXXX. It seems at first ridiculous, especially since XXX appears obviously heterosexual in his relationships with XXXXXX and XXXX. However, remember that XXX is also ineffective with both women. XXX appears (stereotypically--it's 1951 remember) effeminate, especially in relationship to XXXXX. XXX, the strong athlete, is weak on the inside. XXXXX is also conflicted (playing "against himself"), appearing facially and physically strong at first but then displaying some "effeminate" traits (XXXXX's fashion and footwork; his gushing emotionally to XXX in different situations; his receiving a manicure from his doting mother; XXXXX kissing and desperately fondling his mother's hand; other more subtle gay stereotypes that hold cryptic meaning from XXXXXXXXX's point of view). I wish I could hear XXXXXXXXX clarify his intended meanings here.<br /><br />4. Dishonesty and Distrust: XXX makes some colossal blunders in hiding truths about XXXXX from family and from police. XXX fails to fully comprehend that admitting fault quickly may be better than a cover-up or a delay in confession. Again XXX is driven by passivity, insecurity, fear--and perhaps a self-hate that is closer to XXXXX's own self-loathing than we care to see or to admit. Both XXX and XXXXX act out their own parables of impotence.<br /><br />5. Lack of Evidence: XXX feels a problem mustering the evidence to acquit himself. While quickly going to the police would solve a huge problem, XXX traps himself with his own doubts and insecurities: the absence of desired alibis; the inability of the alcoholic professor to testify on XXX's behalf; the obsessive need to appear politically pristine; and other personality factors that cause XXX to feel defenseless. He is as dysfunctional as XXXXX--just not as dangerous (yet one could partially blame XXX for XXXXXX's murder).<br /><br />6. Disease and Mental Disorder: an interesting question is how legally responsible is XXXXX for the murders? The more ethically incompetent XXXXX is as a sick sociopath, the more guilty XXX may be as someone healthy who failed to stand up and morally act to prevent the crimes. XXX's failure is like a man who fails to call the police when a sick friend threatens suicide, and death ensues. One could argue that more than one crime is committed and that XXX is an emotionally hobbled accomplice.<br /><br />These and many other features of the film make "Strangers on a Train" a gem of a morality play, a diamond for philosophical and cinematic reflections.
