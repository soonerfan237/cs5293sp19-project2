Out of all the Bat-films, XXXXXX Returns is my favorite. This beautiful, dark, and funny film is one of XXX Burton's best work. Although it is much violent and darker, this is the Batman that creator XXX Kane envisioned many years ago. XXXXXXX Keaton reprises his role as the avenger of Gotham City. This time he's up against two deadly foes, XXXXX Devito's Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman. With a great cast and film score by XXXXX Elfman, the movie takes us on an adventure as Batman battles the evil forces that are trying to take over Gotham City. XXXXXXXXXXX Walken makes a great appearance as Max Shrek, a shrewd businessman who has an evil scheme up his sleeve. But of course, XXXXXXXX Pfeiffer is the one that steals the show. With all of these components, you have a film that will blow you away. This is the reason why you go to the movies. It's got everything. It's really a shame that XXX Burton didn't get to direct the other sequels. If so I think the franchise would still be going strong today. XXXXXX Returns is an awesome experience for fans that like cool movies.
