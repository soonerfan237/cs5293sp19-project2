for everyone who has read this book, XXXXX Price ends up maturing into her own woman, a beautiful woman...with a brain. XX Touzel looks like she is on medication. Terrible acting, she just ruins it! XXXXX is a little tall for his character. He is also too effeminate. XXXX Crawford is brilliant. Edmond is a little too old. Mrs. Norris is hysterical- OK, this casting decision works. Rushworth is also perfect. Yates looks too effeminate also. But, XX Touzel is simply horrid. This is not a good character for her. XXXX Fanny! I would recommend this movie only because it includes an almost complete textual account of the language XXXXXX uses in the novel. The 1999 version is much more fun but terribly incomplete. If they could redo this version with a better suited actress for Fanny it would be fabulous!
