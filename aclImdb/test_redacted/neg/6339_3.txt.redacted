Disappointing comedy-drama with sentimental coating has XXXXXXX J. XXX ideally cast as a former child star who now runs a talent agency for thespian tots; Nathan Lane and Cyndi Lauper are his assistants. This all sounds as if it can't miss, however too much of the scenario is given over to strident Christina Vidal as a streetwise tyke whom XXX believes will be the next big thing. They lock quickly lock heads, and the bantering dialogue takes them back and forth to an uninteresting, formula finish. XXX and Lane are both appealing, but the energy of the early scenes gives way to treacle. XXXXXXX produced, but ultimately stale. *1/2 from ****
