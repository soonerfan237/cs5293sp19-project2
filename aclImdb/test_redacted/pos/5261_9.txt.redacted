I am a 58 year old man.On a rainy afternoon my wife suggested that we go see The Women. After reading the reviews I thought it might lead to an afternoon nap. Wrong- this movie held my interest from start to finish. It was great to finally see XXX Ryan looking super again. Let's face it Meg looks much better with long hair. XXXXXXX Benning looked different to me in every scene she was in. Candice XXXXXX is showing her age as is Carrie Fisher. The daughter, XXXXX, was exceptionally acted by young India.I was able to understand the dialog which is tough in many current films due to rapid speech. XXXXXX Leachman and the woman from Finland were terrific as the housekeepers who extend their regular duties. The NYC scenes were nice to see. Oh, and XXXXX Midler had a short role but as usual was terrific. So I gave this chick flick a 9. Guys- Go see this even just for the eye candy like XXX Mendes. It won't disappoint.
