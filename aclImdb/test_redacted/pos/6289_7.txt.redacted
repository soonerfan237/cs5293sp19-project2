This is the only XXXXX XXXXX movie you should ever see. O.K., it's the only one I've ever seen, and I think I've made good choices. I normally find XXXXX's shtick kind of tired, but he is very funny in this movie. Actually, the script is pretty funny, and XXXXX doesn't overwhelm the other actors with his ... what do you call it? Tomfoolery? Anyway, this is a funny, if ultimately forgettable film. --Frink-3
