This probably ranks in my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I've ever seen! I was not a big fan of XXXXX Hood, or XXXXX Hood: Prince of Thieves, but this movie was a lot different! It made fun of XXXXX Hood, and was HILARIOUS! I was extremely pleased with how well it was put together, and how well acted it was! Besides XXXX Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, and Houseguest, this was the funniest move I've ever seen! I especially love the song; "We're Men in tights!" If you have a good sense of humor, you'll LOVE this movie!
