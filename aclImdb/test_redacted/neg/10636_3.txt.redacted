I just saw this on TCM tonight and was shocked at the over-acting by XXXX Arthur. Her bugging her eyes out in surprise and just generally over-doing everything was not in the same style as XXXXXXXX and Art Lund. XXXXXXXX was marvelous in her restraint and comic timing. She being the best thing in this movie. The Wilder gags were flat and frankly more like something a freshman in college would write trying to "get away" w/being wicked,witty and dirty, but just sounded boring and not funny at all. It seemed the humor was being pushed too hard to be funny. The ending was totally contrived. <br /><br />SPOILER AHEAD: Never for a moment did I believe that XXX Lund suddenly fell outta love w/Dietrich and then was suddenly madly in love w/XXXhur. Oh, XXXXX. Get real! 3 out of 10.
