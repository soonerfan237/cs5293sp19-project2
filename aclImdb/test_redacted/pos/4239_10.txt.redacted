GREAT MOVIE! Chucky is by far the funniest character in a movie. XXXXXXXX Tilly (Tiffany) makes this movie even better! Well before XXXXXX died Tiffany and him were together. But like ten years later XXXXXXX gets Chucky back (as a doll) and brings him back to life. It was a great movie!Scary and definetly funny (only because XXXXXX!)10/10
