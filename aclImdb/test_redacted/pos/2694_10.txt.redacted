King of Queens is comic genius. XXXXX XXXXX, whom plays IPS deliveryman XXXX XXXXXXXXX is extremely funny, XXXX XXXXXX who plays XXXX's wife XXXXXX is incredibly hot ( # 19 on Stuff magazine's hottest 102 woman list ), and very funny. The true magic of the show However is the scenes with XXXXX XXXXXXX, they are the funniest in the show. XXXXX, a comic genius, plays XXXXXX's father, XXXXXX XXXXXXX, whom lives in XXXX and XXXXXX's always cold basement. I must admit that I never watched this show until this year, 2006. Whenever I had flipped by it previously it never seemed funny, but with the cancellation of Friends, Still Standing, and XXX XXXX, I needed some new comedy. Actually giving The King Of Queens a chance I discovered that it was absolutely fantastic. So funny in fact that I downloaded the first 7 seasons and watched each season in 8 hour blocks. I strongly urge anyone whom has not seen this treasure to check it out. You will not be disappointed.
