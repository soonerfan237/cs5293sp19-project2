This film essentially contains all the elements of a great 70's exploitation film, except it was done in the late 80's for the direct to video market.<br /><br />You have a young couple in love, but the whole world around them is involved either in crack dealing or gang violence. When the boyfriend goes to jail, the girlfriend ends up vulnerable to all the criminals, who are everyone in this movie except for the cops. First she gets hooked on crack by a dealer and then because he owes drug lord XXX XXXXX money, she becomes XXXXX's property. Then she's basically enslaved in a military style crack house that the movie is named for.<br /><br />As if this isn't enough reason to see this movie, you also have XXXXXXX XXXXX playing a seemingly conservative school guidance counselor, but he's really a major crack dealer. In a sleazy yet hilarious scene, he demands sexual favors from the heroine because she has no money for a fix. In an earlier scene it was established that he is her counselor. That scene and another where XXX XXXXX forces her to take a scalding hot shower because she stinks are hysterical. Lead actress XXXXXX XXX was really good in this film. XXXXXXXXX, bring her back.<br /><br />It's not surprising to me that someone mentioned in another review that XXXXXXXXX is a major fan of this. It has just the right blend of comedy, action, sex, romance, and yes a central message to stay away from drugs. XXX XXXXX's villainous turn here deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as another great 80's B villain, XXXXX XXXXXX in Vice Squad. Sometimes I think there should be a b movie XXXXXX where performances like this could be acknowledged. In the meantime let's hope that the modern straight to DVD filmmakers learn learn to use this same type of tongue in cheek humor.
