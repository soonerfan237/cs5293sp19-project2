A recent re-issue of the French crime film (original title 'Du XXXXXX XXXX les XXXXXX'), with its famous 20-minute silent jewel heist sequence, now comes in the US in a gorgeous new print from The Criterion Collection with improved subtitles and some extras. Jules XXXXXX was an American (born Julius XXXXXX in Middletown Connecticut) who was forced to make films in Europe because he was Blacklisted. XXXXXX was well publicized in the US and did well in art houses. Later XXXXXX became a lot more famous in the US for 'Never on Sunday' (1960) starring his wife, the Greek actress and political activist XXXXXX XXXXXXXX. (Greece was again glamorized and popularized for Americans and others with XXXXXXX XXXXX in Mihalis Kakogiannis' 1964 'Zorba the Greek', which was even a big hit in Cairo.) The new XXXXXX DVD includes a recent interview with XXXXXX. I did not previously realize that one of the main robbers, XXXXX the Milanese, was played by XXXXXX, who stepped in when the original actor became unavailable. He's one of the most memorable characters, a dandified Italian safe cracker who speaks no French.<br /><br />Although this classic has all the trappings of French film noir--the black and white twilight world of well lit apartments, shiny black cars, men in suits, the nightclub scenes, including a dramatically filmed and lit title song performed at the club, the stony faces and the Gauloises in hand or mouth--I don't think it's as atmospheric or has quite as distinctive a style as XXXXXXXX's films do. But there's the mesmerizing robbery, which still holds up today as a tour de force. It goes like clockwork, with a fine sense of craft and teamwork among the robbers. Some nosy cops are efficiently dealt with. Things quickly go wrong after they go home and distribute the loot when one of the players gets sloppy and gives a dame a ring with a million-dollar bangle in it. Has there ever been a heist film whose perps lived happily ever after? <br /><br />It's the wordless heist sequence that guarantees this a special place, and XXXXXX, an American director who had an unusually varied and exotic career, deserves full credit for that. He took a novel so conventional he was going to reject it, and added some key elements that make it special. In the event, he couldn't pass on doing the adaptation: he needed the money too much. XXXX Servais, who plays the lead character XXXX le XXXXXXXXXX, was an actor rather down on his luck. His grim face is perfect for the role. He was later to play the lead in XXXXXX's He Who XXXX XXX (1957), which used French actors in Greece for a political tale. 'Topkapi' is a somewhat disappointing 1964 caper film (it pales compared to 'XXXXXX') that also got US distribution. It does have a good setting, but it's wasted, gone all bland and bright and prettified. Of XXXXXX's post-Hollywood oeuvre, 'Never on Sunday,' with its catchy theme song and charismatic heroine, is the popular choice (and won XXXX XXXX at Cannes 1960); 'He Who XXXX XXX' the political choice; 'XXXXXX' the genre choice. An odd piece is his 'Phaedra' with XXXXXXXX and XXXX Perkins (1962). Purists of tough-guy Hollywood genre work would eschew these and favor XXXXXX's early films, which include a prison drama, 'Brute Force' (1947);a cop flick, 'The XXXXX XXXX' (1948); and two hard core noirs, 'Thieves' XXXXXXX' (1949), and 'Night and the City' (1950). Personally I tend to like French noir and American neo-noir spinoffs better than the original American noir source material--hence my enduring fascination with 'XXXXXX'. But XXXXXX is rather unique in having not only made Hollywood noir but then going over to Paris and producing a memorable example of its Fifties French derivative.
