I speak badly of G.I.J.:T.M. mostly because I think it lacked something that G.I. XXX had. Yes It had something that G.I. XXX didn't have like celebrity cameos by Don Johnson, and Burgess Meredith but I think G.I. XXX: The Movie lacked the passion for the characters that the G.I. XXX TV series had. Most of the voice over artists really sounded like they were dead pan and they were going to die at anytime now. It's a good movie but I wouldn't say that it was the greatest movie in the world I.M.H.O. :)<br /><br />Although violence is what G.I. XXX was built on I'd say that Serpentor striking Duke in his chest wasn't the very best way for Charlie Adler's character to go out. Neither was seeing Golobulus remind XXXXX Commander why he was chosen to lead the XXXXX forces and then being horribly mutated after he failed to deliver what XXXXX-La felt was rightfully theirs.<br /><br />It wasn't the best way for the G.I. XXX series to go out but it's better than nothing. :)
