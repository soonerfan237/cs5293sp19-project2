I watched XXXX Mountain and the English Patient again this weekend. The former is a Civil War melodrama about Inman (Jude Law), a Confederate soldier who deserts the army to return to XXX Monroe (Nicole Kidman) a girl he barely knows. Both films were lovingly directed by XXXXXXX Minghella who does an exceptional job. Although, XXXX Mountain is very good it could have been a great movie with the right casting and less folksy, backwoods dialog.<br /><br />Romantic epics need a convincing heroine. The English Patient, had XXXXXXX Scott Thomas who was perfectly cast as the smart, alluring and beautiful Katherine Clifton. The main problem with XXXX Mountain is Ada who seems silly and dim-witted and lacks that quality would make you believe that Inman could become obsessed after one kiss. As an actress XXXXXX has a limited range, she usually plays stern-faced women who face adversity with stoicism. XXXXXX was also too old to play the ing√©nue and Law's love interest. The film needed a young actress who could play charming, warm and vulnerable. For someone who was supposedly enduring hardship and near starvation she seemed ridiculously well-fed and over-dressed. XXXXXX was so impeccably groomed that it looked like she had spent three hours getting made-up for each scene. XXXXXXX Pfieffer in her younger days could have played the part perfectly. Even XXXXXXX Portman would have been an improvement.<br /><br />Renee Zelleweger was more appropriately attired but her animated performance chewed the scenery but maybe she was trying to compensate for Kidman. XXXX Law was in his own silent movie in the Odysseus role, but played his part well. XXX Winstone was excellent as the London/Southern villain.<br /><br />During the Civil War, people were probably not very well educated by today's standards and maybe they did speak in monosyllables. However if you watch BBC adaptations of Dickens, XXXXXX or Mrs. Gaskill everyone is articulate. Maybe this is unrealistic but it would improved my entertainment.
