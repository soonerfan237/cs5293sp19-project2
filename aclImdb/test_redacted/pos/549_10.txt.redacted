I was able to see "Anywhere But Here" last night as a free sneak preview. I absolutely LOVED the film! I was drawn to it because of the realistic portrayal of a mother/daughter relationship...there was definitely a connection between Adele a and XXX. I think that speaks volumes of the outstanding performances of both XXXXX Sarandon and Natalie Portman. XXXXXXXX was just the right actress to portray Adele and after leaving the theater I could not think of another actress in the role. XXXXXXX was also excellent as Ann. She brought a sense of maturity and intelligence to the role that I don't think any other teenage actress could. I think it would the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences should give credit where it is due and nominate both XXXXXXXX and Portman for Awards in the "Actress" and "Supporting Actress" categories. It would be a shame if they were overlooked.
