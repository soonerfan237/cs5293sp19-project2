What a silly movie. While it looks nice, it doesn't make a lot of sense. On the one hand, the film suggests that XXXXX's "madness" was that she was just a woman ahead of her time. On the other hand, she has an obsession that is right out of the worst Victorian novel of the wronged woman, and that does seem a sort of mental problem, like XXXX Havesham in a castle. This movie is what XXXXXXXXX would have been if XXXXXXXXX had not been able to get past Essex's sexual attraction.
