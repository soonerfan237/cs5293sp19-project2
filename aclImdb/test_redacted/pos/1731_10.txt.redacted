Doctor Who is amazing. It is everyones 'cup of tea'. It must be. The boys will like the monsters and the action and adventure and the girls will like the emotion and feelings that go around. <br /><br />XXXXXX Piper was extraordinary as Rose Tyler. She was so emotional and made XXXX so real.<br /><br />David Tennant is also so witty and funny and it is so enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />But now Billie has left and XXXX is stuck on a parallel universe with her on-off boyfriend Mickey and her mother and father (he died when XXXX was a baby but this Pete Tyler is from the Parallel universe). It will be very strange with XXXXXX being the new companion, as I have only ever seen it with Rose (Apart from the Runaway Bride with Catherine Tate).<br /><br />Freema better be good!!!<br /><br />But nobody can beat XXXX!!!
