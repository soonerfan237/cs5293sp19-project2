This movie was amazing. I was in tears by the end of the movie. Okay, I know the acting sucked but that's not what was important. The message came through loud and clear about XXX's love for us and Jesus's sacrifice. The movie was realistic and showed actual human feelings whether it be XXXX's anger of the blond girl's sneers or the guy that asked questions. But it also showed the joy that comes from a true relationship with XXXXXX. The cars were awesome and the actors were very hot and that attracted my eye. But what I liked most about this movie was the clear Gospel message. The mother and pastor supported XXX in his new walk with Christ and tried to be a godly example to others. XXXXX D showed that no matter if you have all the world has to offer, without Christ, it doesn't matter. Nina showed how a misguided but good person can easily miss the mark. I loved this movie and think that it will bring many teenagers to Christ.
