This movie is a great film. The movie shows so many themes all in one amazing film. Driving XXXXXXX centers around Ben (Rupert Grint) a shy 17 year old who is coming of age. The movie goes on about how XXX is sick of his dominating mother and how he just wants to be himself. XXX then meets Evie, who he makes a very special bond with. The two take a journey and in the process XXX finds himself and what a relationship that he and Evie share. This is the movie that you watch by yourself, or with someone else. No matter what, you will all feel what XXX goes through in the movie. It is a very heart warming film that just makes you think whether your driving lessons were ever as emotional or as much of a journey as XXX's Lessons.
