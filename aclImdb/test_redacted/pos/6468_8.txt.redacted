A skillfully directed film by XXXXXX XXXX where a drifter and anti-hero, XXXX XXXXXXXXXX lands in N.Y. to escape a tragic incident in his life, where he killed his brother in an automobile accident as well as going AWOL from the army.<br /><br />Cassavetes, always an intense actor, shows grit in his portrayal of a film. Am surprised that XXXXXXXXXX XXXXX didn't get this part.<br /><br />Ruth White is his mother and does remarkably well in two scenes on the telephone.<br /><br />Once in New York, he befriends XXXXXX XXXXXXX as the two work on the docks. Immediately, XXXX XXXXXX, a bully and villain in this film,takes a dislike to him and tragedy ensues when XXXXXXX tries to defend his friend.<br /><br />Ruby Dee, plays XXXXXXX's wife in this film, and is brilliant in a scene where she urges Cassavetes to reveal the killer of her husband.<br /><br />This is definitely an interesting film of moral values and the loner in society. With the backdrop of tenements, the right mood is depicted in the film.
