with what they had. XXXX and Carolyn were very private so the writers had to put together what they could. I really liked Portia de XXXXX as Carolyn, but Jacqueline Bisset's voice grated on my nerves. She should have used her regular voice. I would have preferred that the whole movie focus on XXXX and Carolyn instead of rehashing stuff we already know about XXXX.
