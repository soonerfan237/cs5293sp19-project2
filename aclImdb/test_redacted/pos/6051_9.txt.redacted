Having been a Marine, I can tell you that the D.I. is as accurate a portrayal to date depicting XXXXXX Corp boot camp and how boys are turned into men. XXXX Webb is excellent as Sgt.Jim Moore, a tough, but fair drill instructor in Paris Island North Carolina. The film centers on one recruit who doesn't seem to "get with the program." A more recent film, XXXX Metal Jacket, also shows life in basic training and is well worth viewing.
