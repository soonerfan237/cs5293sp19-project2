The movie starts out a bit interested with the son interested in a teenage girl his own age. XXXXXXXXX's timid-appearing husband is killed in car crash as she is getting ready to go to Rome and sing as a diva. Matthew objects but comes along. He connects with the young girl again but this time, XXXX is on cocaine. His superb voice, lovely, impetuous mother is in the limelight. She doesn't know how to handle XXXX's addiction. The movie drags on in search of a plot. Clayburgh is in the wrong role and XXXXXXXXXX may have had his head in the moon while directing the picture. The Moon has great symbolism.<br /><br />Save your time. I am perhaps overly generous with 4*.
