After five years in prison, XXXX le Stéphanois (XXXX Servais) meets his dearest friends Jo (XXXX XXXXXX) and the Italian XXXXX XXXXXXX (XXXXXX XXXXXX) and they invite XXXX to steal a couple of jewels from the show-window of the famous jewelry XXXXXX & XXXX XXX, but he declines. XXXX finds his former girlfriend Mado (XXXXX XXXXXXXX), who became the lover of the gangster owner of the night-club L' Âge d' Or XXXXX XXXXXXX (XXXXXX XXXXXXX), and he humiliates her, beating on her back and taking her jewels. Then he calls Jo and XXXXX and proposes a burglary of the safe of the jewelry. They invite the Italian specialist in safes and elegant wolf XXXXX (XXXXX XXXX) to join their team and they plot a perfect heist. They are successful in their plan, but the D. Juan XXXXX makes things go wrong when he gives a valuable ring to his mistress.<br /><br />"Du XXXXXX XXXX les XXXXXX" is a magnificent film-noir, certainly among the best I have seen. The screenplay has credibility, supported by an awesome direction of XXXXX XXXXXX, stunning performances of the cast and great cinematography. XXXX Servais has outstanding performance in the role of a criminal with principles guided by the underworld rules. The famous long silent sequence of the heist is amazing and extremely tense and certainly among the best ones of the cinema history. I am listing this great movie in my list of favorite movies ever. My vote is ten.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Rififi"
