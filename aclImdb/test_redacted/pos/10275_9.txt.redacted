XXXXXX XXXXXXX is playing with the audience with the story of Max (Vincent Cassel) in search of his biggest lost love (XXXXXX XXXXXXXX) just before to get engaged to another woman. XXXXXXX uses many flashbacks sequences without warning so the best way to know where we are in the story is to watch for the actor's haircut. Oherwise it can get very confusing... Still a strong film debut for XXXXXXX, beautifully photographed by XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX (the 5th element, the Messenger), and XXXXXX XXXXXXXX is a darling to watch ... I felt a little disappointed near the end so I gave it 9 out of 10.
