While I agree completely with drvn below about XXXX McCormack flopping a milk-bag out on TV, the rest of the show is fantastic! XXXX Hartman was great in a professorly way, teaching the celebs the ins and outs. XXXXX's a nut, but in a good way. You never know what self depricating humor he's going to come up with next. As for the game play, it's entertaining, filled with witty banter, and great for any newbie that may have even a passing an interest in the game. Too bad it isn't on anymore :( I just checked the schedule all the way to August and it doesn't appear to be scheduled for any time in the future. XXX Bravo! You deserve a beating!
