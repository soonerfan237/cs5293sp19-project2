And with those words one of the great movie publicity campaigns came to a conclusion. 'XXXXX Talks' and she spoke those words in her first sound film, an adaption of the XXXXXX XXXXXX play XXXX XXXXXXXX. <br /><br />Unlike with some other players and some other studios, MGM took great care in finding the proper vehicle for XXXXX XXXXX. Many players who were fine in the universal medium of silent film would lose their careers because of talkies. Their heavy native accents would get in the way, some didn't know any English. <br /><br />It was no accident that XXXX XXXXXXXX was chosen for XXXXX. First of all it being authored by one of America's leading playwrights, it was the kind of literary property that would have appealed to her. Secondly since the title role was someone who was Swedish, the accent could be explained. Finally a lot of the kinks from early talkies had been worked out, even though XXXX XXXXXXXX still made use of title cards.<br /><br />Like most of O'Neil's work it's short on action, but long and deep on characterization. The story takes place on the New York waterfront where XXXXX as XXXX has come to live with her father XXXXXX XXXXXX. XXXXXX ran away to sea years ago when XXXX was a baby and XXXXXX abandoned his wife. XXXX has had to do what she could to survive in the adult world and that includes prostitution.<br /><br />XXXXXX of course is glad to see her, he even kicks out XXXXX XXXXXXXX, the old waterfront crone he's been living with for years to make room for his flesh and blood. Of course both XXXXXX and XXXXX have their problems adjusting to each other, not made easy when they give shelter to a sailor played by XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX who takes a fancy to XXXXX.<br /><br />XXXXXX is repeating his role from the original Broadway production. The role of XXXX on stage was done by XXXXXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXXXXXX ran for 177 performances in the 1921-22 season on Broadway. It's one of O'Neil's best known works and one that's revived frequently. <br /><br />Of course XXXXX's performance with perfect diction even with a Swedish accent was acclaimed and her future in sound films was assured. XXXXX XXXXX received an Oscar nomination for XXXX XXXXXXX and the film also got nominations for XXXXXXXX XXXXX as XXXX XXXXXXXX and XXXXXXX XXXXXXX for XXXXXXXXXXXXXX. Daniels should especially get a lot of kudos for the way he photographed the waterfront scenes. And XXXXX created the mood around the waterfront where the film is set.<br /><br />XXXXXX XXXXXX's work is timeless so XXXX XXXXXXXX even with a lot of the trappings of early sound films does not date the way many films of that era do. XXXXX also shows she mastered the subtlety needed to work in the sound medium. XXXX XXXXXXXX is a classic, all the way around.
