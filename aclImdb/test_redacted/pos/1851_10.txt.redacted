I love this movie! It has everything! XXXXXX Hunt did a fantastic job co-writing, directing and co-starring in this film. XXXXX Duchovny is just plain hot. and XXXXXX Driver is as cute as ever. combine all that talent with XXXXX Allen Grier, Carol O'Connor, Robert Loggia, Joley Richardson, and Jim Belushi you have a Oscar worthy movie! I'm surprised they didn't get one. if you haven't seen it, go rent the DVD, watch it once then put directors commentary on...XXXXXX Hunt is Fabulous!
