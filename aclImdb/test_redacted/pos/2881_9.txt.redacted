XXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXX's (Look Back in Anger, The Entertainer) dramatisation of XXXXX XXXXX's only novel positively revels in the homosexual subtext of the original, perhaps too much so. Nonetheless, the dialogue, the acting, with a cast headed by XXX XXXX XXXXXXX & XXXXXX XXXXX, and the brilliantly cerebral production (marred only by a "too quick" ending) make this worth the while of any lover of Theater, with a capital "T".
