Dolelemite (1975) is a cult classic. Starring XXXX Ray Moore as the pimp superhero out to wrong rights whilst challenging the MAN along the way. He has two enemies, that no good XXXXXX Green and the sleazy mayor. XXXXX Dolemite kick, punch, slap and pimp his way across the screen. What's the man's name? DOLEMITE!<br /><br />Interesting film that paved the way for a generation of rappers and performers. To sell more of his party albums, XXXX Ray Moore made several on the cheap films during the seventies. XXXX produced and marketed he catered towards a specific audience. Some people call it blacksploitation others call it trash, I call it entertaining. XXXXXXXX was followed by the semi-sequel The Human Tornado and a direct to video Return of XXXXXXXX 25 years later.<br /><br />Highly recommended, a definite cult classic! <br /><br />Footnotes, if the film was properly matted on video you wouldn't see the boom mikes. XXXXXXXX was cut to receive an R-rating.
