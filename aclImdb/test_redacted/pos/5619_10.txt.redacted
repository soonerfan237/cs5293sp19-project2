For many years, XXXXXX XXXXXXX tried to bring his friend XXXXXX XXXXXXX to the screen. One evening when XXXXXXX and his wife Frances were having dinner with XXXXXXX and his wife, silent screen star XXXXXXXX XXXXX, XXXXXXX proposed that XXXXXXX star in a movie. After some persuasion, XXXXXXX agreed, on the condition that his acting be kept to a minimum. And the movie, originally titled "XXXXX XXXXXX" was born.<br /><br />The story itself is rather stock: A streetwise boy (Gene XXXXXXXX, who is best known as the producer of "M*A*S*H"), runs away from home and ends up at a financially troubled music school run by Professor Lawson (XXXXXX XXXXXXX). While attempting to raise funds for the school, the boy and some other kids happen across XXXXXXX at Carnegie Hall. After much ado, XXXXXXX ends up appearing at the school concert and sponsoring the school. <br /><br />The story, while predictable,is surprisingly well written, although the film contains several minor gaffes where different scenes were patched together, the most obvious being the young cellist who is sent out of the orchestra room on an errand and is seen sitting in the orchestra a few seconds later.<br /><br />What is not surprising is how good the acting is. As was customary for studios then, the studio surrounded the inexperienced star with veteran talent: XXXXXXX, XXXX XXXXXX, XXXXXX XXXXX, XXXXXX XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXX (later of Ma and XX XXXXXX fame), XXXXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXXXX, and a Who's Who of character actors. XXXXXXX XXXXX XXXX and singer/actress XXXX XXXXXX made their (uncredited) debuts in this film, as did longtime XXXXXX XXXX singing partner XXXX XXXXXXXX (as XXXXXXXXXX XXXX). Child veteran actors XXXXXXXX, XXXXXX XXXXXX and XXXXX XXXXXXX also appear.<br /><br />XXXXXXX hired the XXXXX XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX, a highly regarded youth orchestra from the Los Angeles Area, to appear in the film. Most of the kids in the orchestra weren't actors, but they were excellent musicians, as good as professionals (which many of them later became). Many of the kids in the orchestra went on to noteworthy careers: XXXX XXXXXX and XXXXX XXXX both starred in the theater and movies, XXXXXXX XXXXXX was a producer and director, Mitchell Lurie founded a well-known music supply company, XXXXXXX XXXXXXXX went on to be a prominent cardiologist, XXXXX XXXXX was a band leader, XXXXXX XXXXX a conductor with different symphonies, Channing Robbins a prominent instructor at the Julliard School, his sister XXXXX XXXXXXX an instructor witn SUNY Stonybrook, and many of the kids in the orchestra pursued musical careers with major symphony orchestras.<br /><br />While XXXXXXX's acting was kept to a minimum, his salary wasn't. He commanded $70,000 for seven weeks. When some scenes had to be re-shot at a later date, he got an additional $50,000 for another four weeks. What thankfully wasn't kept to a minimum was his musical output. Composer XXXXXX XXXXXXX (who was once a Meremblum Orchestra conductor) handled the scoring. XXXXXXX performs the "Introductionne and XXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX" by XXXXXXX Saint-Saens, his own arrangement of XXXXXX XXXXX's "Estrellita" (with an off-screen XXXXX XXXXXXXXXX accompanying), XXXXXX's devilishly difficult "XXXX XXXXXXXX" (from a Vitaphone recording, with XXXXXXX XXX at the piano), an excerpt from Tchaikovsky's "Melody", an excerpt arranged for violin solo from Tchaikovsky's well-known "XXXXXX XXXXXXXXX" from his opus 11 string quartet (played during the opening credits at the beginning of the movie), and the final movement from XXXXX Mendelssohn-Barthody's E Minor XXXXXX XXXXXXXX. During all of these performances, there are many closeups of XXXXXXX's performing, including some very close shots of his fingering and bowing, something that would be of value to violinists desiring to study his technique.<br /><br />The Meremblum orchestra also shines here, performing the arias "XXXX XXXX" by XXXXX and "XXXXX XXXX" by Bellini, (both with Sherwood singing ), an arrangement of the overture from XXXXXXX's "Barber of Seville", a short excerpt from Mozart's "XXXX XXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX", and the previously-mentioned Mendelssohn concerto (with XXXXXXX). XXXXX XXXX can be heard in the background of one scene, performing part of XXXXXX's Nocturne in B-flat Minor, and a five year old Mary Ruth performs XXXXXX's popular "Minute" Waltz.<br /><br />All in all, this is an excellent movie. AMC showed this regularly up until early 1992. I haven't seen it on television in recent years, but copies of it are not difficult to obtain. If you have the chance, I highly recommend that you view the movie.
