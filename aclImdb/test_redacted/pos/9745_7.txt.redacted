XXXXX Gordon is, undoubtedly, the best of all American serials. In a date so early as 1936,XXXXXXXXX was capable of making such an entertainment story, and twenty years later when I watched it for the first time as a kid it involved me in a great adventure and emotion. XXXXXX Crabbe was the hero we always wanted to be in our childhood, and Jean Rogers the beautiful girl we always dreamt to be in love with. Dragons, octopus, monsters,gorillas were also the attraction. XXXXXXX Middleton was a great presence as Ming, the Merciless. A true predecessor of XXXXXX LucasÂ´s Starwars.
