DRIVING LESSONS is a little film that sneaks up on you. What at first seems to be a bit of fluffy nonsense comedy British style is at its base a very fine story about coming of age and the needs for significant friendship of both the young and the elderly. XXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXX ('Mrs. XXXXX', 'Charlotte XXXX', 'The Last King of Scotland') here directs his own screenplay and the result is a cohesive, progressively involving tale filled with fascinating and diverse characters, each performed by sterling actors.<br /><br />XXX Marshall (XXXXXX XXXXX, standing firmly on his own as a developing actor post 'Harry XXXXXX' series) is a quiet, plain little poetic seventeen-year-old living with his bird watching XXXXX father (XXXXXXXX XXXXXXX) and his obsessive compulsive, rigid, evangelical do-gooder mother (XXXXX XXXXXX) in a home where 'needy people', such as the murderous cross-dressing XXX XXXXXXX (XXX XXXXXX), take precedence over family matters: the mother is by the way having an affair with priest Peter (XXXXXX XXXXXXX), using XXX as her cover! XXX XXX is among other things attempting to learn to drive a car. His mother is a poor teacher and decides he needs professional lessons AND needs to get a job to help pay for poor XXX XXXXXXX's needs. XXX follows an ad and meets XXXX XXX XXXXXX (XXXXX XXXXXXX), an elderly has-been actress who is as zany as any character ever created. She hires XXX and the fireworks begin. Through a series of incidents, including a camping trip XXXX demands they take, the two learn life's lessons missing from each other's natures: XXX learns self respect and self confidence and XXXX finds a true friend who will allow her to drop her stagy facade and be the dear human being she has been hiding.<br /><br />XXXXX XXXXXXX, always offering the finest skills of acting in every character she creates, finds a role like no other here: she is outlandishly wild and lovable. XXXXXX XXXXX is exactly the right choice for the challenged coming of age XXX. The chemistry between the two is as tender as that in the classic film 'Harold and XXXXX'. XXXXX XXXXXX is as always a superb actress playing a role quite different from her usual repertoire. And the supporting cast is a panorama of fine characterizations. This film is a delightful surprise and one sure to warm the heart and entertain those who love fine writing and direction and acting - and message! XXXXX Harp
