XXXXX Andrews satirically prods her own goody-two-shoes image in this overproduced musical comedy-drama, but if she approaches her role with aplomb, she's alone in doing so. XXXXX Edwards' film about a woman who is both music-hall entertainer and German spy during WWI doesn't know what tone to aim for, and Rock Hudson has the thankless task of playing romantic second-fiddle. XXXXXXXX had grown out of favor by 1970, and elephantine productions like "Star!" and this film really tarnished XXXXXXX' reputation, leaving a lot of dead space in her catalogue until "The Tamarind Seed" came along. I've always thought XXXXX Andrews would've made a great villain or shady lady; her strong voice could really command attention, and she hits some low notes that can either be imposing or seductive. Husband/director Edwards seems to realize this, but neither he nor XXXXX can work up much energy within this scenario. Screenwriter XXXXXXX Peter Blatty isn't a good partner for Edwards, and neither man has his heart in this material. Beatty's script offers XXXXXXX just one fabulous sequence--a striptease. *1/2 from ****
