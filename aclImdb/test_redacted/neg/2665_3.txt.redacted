The stranger Jack (XXXXXXX Lillard) arrives in the studio of the crook collector of antiques Max (Vincent D'Onofrio) and tells his ambitious companion and specialist in poisons Jamie (Valeria Golino) that he is Jack's brother. XXXXX does not buy his story, dominates Jack and ties him up to a chair. When XXX arrives, Jack proposes US$ 100,000.00 for each one to protect him in a negotiation of the antiques "Spanish Judges" with a wealthy and dangerous collector. Max invites his stupid acquaintance Piece (XXXX Boone Junior), who comes with his retarded girlfriend that believes she is from Mars, to compose the backup team. However, XXXX double-crosses the collector and then he intrigues XXXX, Jamie and Piece.<br /><br />The low budget "Spanish Judges" is a movie with a reasonable screenplay with an awful conclusion that wastes a good cast. Valeria Golino is astonishingly beautiful but together with the good actor XXXXXXX D'Onofrio, they are not able to save the stupid story. Further, the scenes that are supposed to be funny unfortunately do not work, and actually they are silly and not funny. My vote is three.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "XXXX Por Dinheiro" ("All For Money")
