This is a funny movie. The Bob & XXXXX Show feel of it could lead to a sequel but I doubt it will make enough money. <br /><br />XXXXXX proves he can be a great Straight man again with some hilarious and spontaneous moments. XXXXX was fun to watch working with people instead of CGI animals and rodents. XXXX Russo- well she's just fun to watch anyway and she's played her part excellent.<br /><br />Some wild and unusual stunts, especially the garbage truck scene. This was worth seeing in the theater. We needed a good laugh and got many from the movie and the great out-takes at the end. DO NOT LEAVE at the start of the credits!<br /><br />At least a 7.
