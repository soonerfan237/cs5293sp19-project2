A CBS radio program entitled "We the People" assists in finding an American home for Vienna refugee XXXXXXX Coburn (as Karl Braun), a skilled surgeon and pool hustler. He arrives with beautiful daughter XXXXXX Gurie (as Leni), who is "studying" to become a nurse. Relocated to a small, dusty Midwestern village, they are welcomed at the station by burly XXXX Wayne (as XXXX Phillips) and his uncle Spencer Charters (as 'Nunk' Atterbury), a veterinarian. Ms. XXXXX is unhappy in the dustbowl, and wants to leave. Immediately. But, the prospect of romance with XXX Wayne might change her mind...<br /><br />God answers the citizens' many prayers for rain, but it may not be enough to save the farming town. The entire town is advised to relocate to Oregon. Wayne wants to stay and tough it out. Coburn receives an invitation to work at a top clinic. And, XXXXX learns her fianc√©, presumed dead, will be arriving to claim her as his wife. She feels duty-bound to accept; but, he has a dark secret... This film does not flatter XXXXX, who seems way out of his element. Being paired with XXXXX, promoted as another Garbo, doesn't help. They do have a cute scene in Wayne's car ("XXXXXX, an Italian car").<br /><br />**** Three Faces West (7/3/40) Bernard Vorhaus ~ John Wayne, Sigrid Gurie, Charles Coburn, Spencer Charters
