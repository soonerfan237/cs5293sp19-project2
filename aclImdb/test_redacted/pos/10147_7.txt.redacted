Lovely little thriller from XXXXXXXXX, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists. XXXXX XXXXXXX is as ever a great hero for XXXXXXXXX, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of XXXXXXXXX's black and white, low-budget original. Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.
