I have read all of XXXX XXXXXX's novels right the way through once a year every year since I was 9 years old and received the Modern Library edition of her collected works as a birthday present. <br /><br />I loved this movie for its romance and for the music, which stayed, hauntingly, in my head. It was an interpretation of course, not an Emma or a Sense and Sensibility, but something quite different and something XXXXXXXXX herself would have loved. And oh to be loved by this passionate XXXXX! This was the XXXXX of XXXXXXXXX's imagination, and she is the romantic heroine she read about in her novels, and which was promised to us by the practical XXXX XXXXXX who tells us right at the beginning that the unlikely XXXXXXXXX will indeed be one. I wonder if XXXX was being entirely satirical in her novel. Perhaps, she too, could imagine such a XXXXX. <br /><br />I haven't seen the film in many years, at least a decade. But, I have been yearning for it ever since.
