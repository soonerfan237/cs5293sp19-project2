Don't hate XXXXXXX Graham because she's beautiful, hate her because she's fun to watch in this movie. Like the hip clothing and funky surroundings, the actors in this flick work well together. XXXXX Affleck is hysterical and Heather Graham literally lights up the screen. The minor characters - XXXXX Visnjic {sigh} and Patricia Velazquez are as TALENTED as they are gorgeous. Congratulations Miramax & XXXXXXXX Lisa Krueger!
