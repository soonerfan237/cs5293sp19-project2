This is a Very Very Boring and uninteresting action film, and without XXXXX Norris it would have been unbearable!, plus the low budget shows big time!. Some of the fights were good, but the story is laughable, and there no menacing villains at all.The dialog was laughable I had some trouble finishing this film, but XXXXX Norris, made it somewhat bearable. I really have nothing more to say, since i was only paying half attention,because it was so incredibly boring however it did pick up a tiny bit towards the end. The Direction is terrible. XXX Hulette, does a terrible job here, with lousy photography, an awful pace, and overall the film looked dull!. There is no gore. The Acting was terrible. XXXXX Norris is very good here, he kicks that ass, and he made the film almost bearable(XXXXX rules!). XXXXXX Murdock, is terrible as the main villain, and very unconvincing. XXXXX O'Connor, is decent here, and had okay chemistry with Chuck. XXXXXXX Augenstein, is decent as Chuck's brother. Overall It's quite simple AVOID! * Out of 5 (XXXXX saves it from the BOMB rating).
