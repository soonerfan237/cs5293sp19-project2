GZSZ is the longest running daily soap in Germany and it's cult! I started watching it from the first day on and I got hooked on it right from the start. Over the years so much has changed, the old characters like XXXXX, Elke, Tina, Saskia etc. left, and new ones appeared like XXXXX, Kai, Cora or John. I have to say that I liked GZSZ better in the years 1995-2000 because today the show focuses too much on the younger characters. My favorite character is XXXXX Wiebe because she is the most scheming person that has ever been on that soap and she is also one of the most interesting characters on the show. Tina XXXXXXX was great as the first Sonja but as Tokessa became the recast of Sonja the character got even better.
