For only doing a few movies with his life the Late Great Chris XXXXXX. XXXXXX died at the end of 1997 and will be missed mostly by his co actor in XXXXX XXX, XXXXX XXXXX. From the lame Police Academy 4 Spade really has done good with his career in films. XXXXX XXX is a classic and we will always remember Chris XXXXXX when we watch it. From appearing on Saturday NIGHT LIVE to doing XXXXX XXX, XXXXX XXXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, XXXXXX XXXXXX, XXXXX XXXXXXX, and XXXXX XXXX. I think Chris XXXXXX had a short and successful career. XXXXX XXX was his best in my case and I would watch over and over again and laugh at the same part each time. Thank you Chris XXXXXX.
