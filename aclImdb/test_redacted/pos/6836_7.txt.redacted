This movie was a pleasant surprise for me. In all honesty, the previews looked horrible, up until the point where XXXX Thompson and Alan Rickman appeared. So I rented it with reservation, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It had great acting, a few good plot twists, and, of course, XXXX Thompson and Alan Rickman. It's definitely worth checking out.
