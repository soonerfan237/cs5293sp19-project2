Having just got the "XXXXX Tunes Golden Collection"(which i HIGHLY recommend, by the way), I'm going to try to comment on most if not all of the cartoons individually. As such the starting statement might seem redundant for those whom read multiple reviews of them, for this i apologize.<br /><br />XXXXXX Seasoning is the middle short in a trilogy of like-minded shorts (the other two being "XXXXXX Fire" and "Duck! Rabbit, Duck). Bags and XXXXX argue about who Elmer Fudd should short. It makes me laugh EVERY SINGLE TIME!!! On the DVD it has a commentary, featurette, & option to play it music only.<br /><br />My Grade: A+<br /><br />DVD Extras: Disk 1: an introduction by XXXXX Jones; The Boy of Termite Terrice part 1; clips from the films "Two Guys from Texas" and "My Dream is Yours", both with Bugs cameos; Bridging sequences for an episode of "the Bugs Bunny show"; the Astro Nuts audio recording session; 2 vintage trailers; "Blooper Bunny: Bugs Bunny 51st and a half anniversary" with optional commentary with writer Greg Ford & stills gallery
