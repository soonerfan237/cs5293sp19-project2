For many years I thought I was the only person on the planet who had seen TEMPEST, and I am so glad to learn that I am not the only person who discovered this sleeper somewhere in their movie-going travails. Loosely based on the Shakesperean play, TEMPEST follows an architect (the late XXXX XXXXXXXXXXX, in one of his best performances), bored with his work and his crumbling marriage (to real life spouse XXXX XXXXXXX), who decides to chuck it all, say the hell with the rat race and go live on an island with his daughter (XXXXX XXXXXXXX, in her film debut), and new girlfriend Aretha (a luminous XXXXX XXXXXXXX). Even though XXXX XXXXXXXX is credited as director, XXXXXXXXXXX hand is all over this film...the long scenes filmed without cutting, the improvisatory feel to the dialogue..., the self-indulgent storytelling style, this is definitely his show from beginning to end, and if you're not a fan of his work, the film will seem laboriously long and dull but if you are a fan, there are rewards to be had. XXXXXXXXXXX is surrounded by a first rate cast...his scenes with XXXXXXXX crackle with intensity and his surprising chemistry with XXXXXXXX is a stark contrast to his scenes with XXXXXXXX. Ringwald shines in her film debut and there is a scene-stealing performance by the late XXXX XXXXX as XXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXX' manservant on the island. Julia stops the show in one scene dancing with a flock of sheep accompanied by XXXX XXXXXXXX singing "New York, New York". This film is sad and tragic and funny and intense. Yes, it's a little long and disjointed and it works a little too hard at being different (there's even a curtain call at the end of the film), but it never fails to hold the attention of those who like something a little different in their filmgoing.
