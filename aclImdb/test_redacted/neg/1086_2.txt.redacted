I am very surprised to see the good ratings for this movie.<br /><br />I watched the film 9 years ago and I still remember how angry I felt to sit in the movie theatre and to look at this mess. I am a big fan of XXXX Boorman's work. I really like his movies. So I went to "XXXXXX Rangoon" with big expectations. But I felt like watching a dumb, cheap XXXXX Norris jungle movie with all action scenes cut out. Even the soundtrack was very annoying.<br /><br />I can't believe that XXXX Boorman was the director because this movie was so badly done. I think the Burmese people deserve better films to illustrate their struggle.
