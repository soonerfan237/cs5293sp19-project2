A lot has already been written about the film itself, so instead of adding to the noise I just want to say a few words on the two female actors.<br /><br />It has to be a daunting prospect for any actress to star, in a sense, versus the spectacular XXXXXX Bellucci, but Romane Bohringer pulls it off to sensational ends. A film starring XXXXXX Bellucci where I fall in love with the other girl?? That's not supposed to happen.<br /><br />It's been said a thousand times, but XXXXXX Bellucci strikes the saddest figure in modern cinema. I have never before seen such innate sadness. She would not be out of place breaking XXX Chaney's heart.
