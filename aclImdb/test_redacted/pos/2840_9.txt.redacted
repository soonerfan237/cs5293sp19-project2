This movie just might make you cooooo. The film was WELL worth the dark trip to town. Betty (XXXXX XXXXXXXXX)is the lone "acceptable" soap groupie out there. Her character is SO charming and SO convincing that you find yourself in forgiveness over her being such a goof. I might even allow myself to get lost in Bettys' adorable fantasy, if it weren't for the fact that Dr. XXXXXX's real name is XXXXXX... And speak of the devil; "looker" XXXX XXXXXXX fills his role VERY well. While Charlie (Morgan Freeman) makes you wish for his wish to come true, Wesley (XXXXX XXXX) makes you want to tie him to a chair. And Rosa(Tia Texada)takes you back to those luminous grade-school friendships. The sheriff encourages you to feed him donuts and loose his name. The remainder of the cast fits well. Never one to do the same movie twice, XXXXX XXXXX is the exception. One of these long, cold, needing to smile about something winter days.
