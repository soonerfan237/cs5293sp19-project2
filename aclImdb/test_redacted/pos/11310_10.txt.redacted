"Medusa: Dare to be Truthful" is an outrageously funny parody that is a fine companion to the original, "XXXXXXX: Truth or Dare". XXXXX XXXXX's brilliant creation skewers XXXXXXX's highly entertaining documentary (although it wasn't exactly daring, insightful, candid, or truthful) with a faithfulness to detail, right down to the packaging. I highly recommend this for XXXXXXX fans, XXXXX XXXXX fans, or anyone who enjoys sharp and clever parody.
