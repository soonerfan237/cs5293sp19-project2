Years before pre-nuptial agreements became a regular thing, XXXXXX XXXXXXXX made a screen comedy on which they are the basis. XXXXXXXXX's XXXXXX XXXX involves XXXX XXXXXX as a multi-millionaire living on the French Riviera who's been married seven times and now marries XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXX for number eight. But XXXXXX's a good sport about it, he always settles with his ex-wives for a $50,000.00 a year as per an agreement they sign before marrying him. Sounds like what we now call a pre-nuptial agreement.<br /><br />Of course XXXXXXXXX wants a lot more than that and she feels XXXXXX takes an entirely too business like approach to marriage. She'd like the real deal and is willing to go some considerable lengths to get it.<br /><br />XXXXXXXXX's XXXXXX XXXX has some really funny moments, the original meeting of XXXXXX and XXXXXXX in a men's store where XXXXXX is insisting he wants only pajama tops and XXXXXXX looking for only bottoms. And of course my favorite is XXXXXXX trailing and blackmailing the detective XXXXXX sends to spy on her. XXXXXX Bing has the best supporting role in the film as that selfsame, flustered detective.<br /><br />I've often wondered how back in the day XXXXXXXXX could get away with casting so many people who are non-French in a film like this. Of course XXXXXX is an American and XXXXXXX of the cast is the only one actually of French background. Though XXXXX XXXXX is charming as always, having him be a Frenchman is ludicrous, he is sooooooo British.<br /><br />Nevertheless XXXXXXXXX's XXXXXX XXXX is an enjoyable film and a great example of what was called 'the Lubitsch touch' back in the day.
