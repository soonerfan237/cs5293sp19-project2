I don't go for that many "heist" comedies, and I might not care for this one if it weren't for the actors, when it was made, and when I FIRST SAW it (just a few years later). It's almost too similar to "The Happening" (even though it's obviously a much less serious comedy than that one) - Mafia figure takes over his own kidnapping, or rather, turns it in a different direction altogether. Of course, XXXXXX XXXXX didn't play the kind of sharp character XXXX XXXXXXX did in The Happening, but that doesn't make it a sexist film either - she was practically playing a stock character, almost HER version of a "moll"! But, I'm completely biased - it's among the first films I ever saw with her, and at the time I saw it, you couldn't turn around without seeing a poster of her (luckily). I think XXXXXX XXXXXX was really just right as the neither thoroughly likable nor dis-likable leader of the group, as were XXXXXX XX XXXXXXXX (naturally) and Vittoria De Sica. And XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX, an actor who always managed to be funny.
