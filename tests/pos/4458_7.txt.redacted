This has some excellent spots but the length of the film can not sustain the wafer thin plot. It is another sailors on leave film, zippier than XXXXXXX's 'Follow the Fleet' but not as good as 'On The Town'. <br /><br />XXXXXXX XXXXXXX is bland but XXXXX and XXXXXXX work well together. Their 'If you XXXX XXXXX' number is hilarious as they make up the song as they sing it. 'I Begged XXX' is also fun with XXXXXXX showing how adept he was at hoofing. XXXXXXX's solo songs are dull and seem to be inserted to show off his singing rather than as part of the story. Fortunately there are accomplished supporting actors like XXXXX XXXXXX, XXXX XXXXXXX, XXXXXX XXXXXXX and XXXXXX XXXXXXX and an unlikely but impertubable XXXX XXXXXX as himself, to keep one watching.<br /><br />XXXXX is the star of the film, although third billed and it is interesting to see him interact with children, which XXXXXXX never did. Dean Stockwell plays a child who wants to be in the navy and latches on to the XXXXX character. He also visit a school resulting in him telling the children a fictitious story of his life in the Pomeranian (!)navy which leads to his wonderful dance with an animated XXXXX XXXXX. In another scene he dances a charming Mexican Hat Dance with a sublimely grave faced little girl, XXXXXX XXXXXXX, that is entrancing and sweet. <br /><br />Very pleasant then but a bit too long. A taster of better musicals to come.
