This was okay, but really a bit disappointing because I expected more laughs. Considering the storyline and the lead actor (XXXX Murray), it should have been a lot funnier than it turned out to be. Only part of this made me really laugh, such as when XXXXXX lost control of his semi and was speeding down the road at a weird angle. (You have to see it, to appreciate it.)<br /><br />The supporting cast was anything but likable people. Just look at a sampling of the names: XXXXXXX McConaughey, Janeane Garofalo and Linda Fiorentino. Yecch! McConaughey's role in here as "XXX Tucker" was just downright annoying. He was the worst. <br /><br />Other that those people, the movie had some charming moments but overall it is not recommended. It's another Disney flop.
