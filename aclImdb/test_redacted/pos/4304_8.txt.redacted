This is my favourite XXXXXXX. XXXXXX Landau (excellent!) plays twins, one of whom may have committed a murder. This XXXXXXX is unusual because the usual murder scene at the beginning doesn't give you any clue to which one did it! XXXXX Falk is on form as usual in this episode written by XXXXXX XXXXXX (who also wrote 'Murder by the Book', my second favourite episode). The supporting cast are great especially XXXXX XXXXXX (very under-rated) and XXXXXXXX XXXXX as the house keeper that XXXXXXX just keeps on upsetting. The surname of XXXXXX Landau's characters in this is 'Paris'. That was the surname of XXXXXXX XXXXX's character in Mission Impossible. Coincidence? Or a XXXXXX XXXXXX joke?
