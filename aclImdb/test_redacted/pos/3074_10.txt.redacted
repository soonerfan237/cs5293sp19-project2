I don't think I have ever seen a better movie parody. XXX Brooks is insane. EVERY time I watch it I find something new and it makes it even more funny than the time before. Cary XXXXX is perfect for the role of Robin Hood. It has a great and unexpected ending that leaves you cracking up. Every character is great from Little XXXX and Will to Maid Marian and Broomhilde. I laughed the whole way through and will never get tired of it. Watch it!!<br /><br />If you liked XXXX Elwes in this Movie, you must definitely see The Princess Bride.
