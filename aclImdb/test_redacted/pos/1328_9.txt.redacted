XXXXX's twelve is probably better than XXXXX's eleven. I know most people would disagree, But I actually liked it more. After three years, it was good seeing the gang return. The reason behind the heist is a bit more inspired the second time around. I see why they stole from Benedict(XXXX Garcia) in the last film. This film they have a bit more motivation the second time around. XXXXX's twelve is more entertaining, and cooler than XXXXX's eleven. With a funny cameo by XXXXXX Grace saying "I just walked in that new Dennis Quaid movie" and other things. I think XXXXX's Twelve is probably the best in the series.<br /><br />The Plot: A year or so after XXXXX's Twelve, Terry Benedict(the guy they robbed in the last film) is back and says that if XXXXX's eleven doesn't pay him back the money they stole, he's going to call the cops. So XXXXX Ocean and the gang go to Europe, where Rusty meets his old cop girlfriend Isabelle. After she meets him again, she begins to follow them around. Also, the gang learns that they have an enemy who is also a thief who is a little better than they are.<br /><br />With many funny scenes like when Tess(XXXXX Roberts) goes to Europe and pretends to be XXXXX Roberts, Ocean's Twelve is a pretty clever film. It's cooler, funnier, and more entertaining than XXXXX's eleven.
