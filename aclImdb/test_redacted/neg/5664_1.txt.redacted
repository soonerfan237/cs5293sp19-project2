I watched the Halloween episode...oh my god I wanted to die. The acting was just awful. The lines were uttered with absolutely no conviction. Its a bad idea for a show as well, I mean who would watch some web show like that in real life? XXXXXXX Cosgrove was great in a supporting role in Drake and Josh but doesn't have the force of character to anchor her own show. I'm even more upset because her leaving is a major reason why XXXXX and Josh ended. She was approached with her own show...she jumped ship on XXXXX and Josh. They then decided that maybe they would do a thing with XXXXX and Josh moving to college, thereby explaining the loss of Meagan as a character but XXXXX had already had thoughts of moving on to bigger and better things and he figured if Miranda did it why couldn't he. The best part of the show was the theme song... a catchy, good tune in a mire of mediocrity. Of course XXXXX Bell was dubbing Miranda's voice for the whole thing and wrote the tune...
