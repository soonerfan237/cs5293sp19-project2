I loved the movie. I loved XXXXXXX Dalton and Joanne Whaley. The movie had many different locations in it. I really liked when XXX Hampton realized she could not make Rhett love her. And when XXXXXXXX and Ann where together and Ann apologizes for taking Rhett and XXXXXXXX just told her not to worry she would get him back. It had a great story it told. You just can not compare it to GWTW. It just has so many great scenes. I love both SCARLETT AND GWTW! Of course do not forget to have a hankie handy.
