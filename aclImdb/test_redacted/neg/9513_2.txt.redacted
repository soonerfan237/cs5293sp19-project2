This is by far the worst version of XXXXXXX Shakespeare's tragic masterpiece I have ever seen. It seems the filmmakers didn't actually read XXXXXXXXXXX's text. No, they just took what they wanted from the Lawerence Olivier movie. The plot is out of order and slimmed down to its bare necessity, yet there is time for the non-canon XXXXXXX created incest hint between Hamlet and Queen Gertrude. Could we have had the "Something rotten in the state of Denmark" bit instead? Casting is another issue. I understand that the far superior Branagh movie had its weak bits (XXXXX Williams and Charlton Heston come to mind), but this one has very few good moments. I do like XXXXXXX and Polonius, but the rest of the cast is stale. XXX Gibson's creepy stubble is irritating, and one often wonders if he has any idea what he is saying. Many of the actors seem to have just memorized the part--they know less about what is being said than sophomores in high school.<br /><br />If you want a version of Hamlet, check out XXXXXXX Branagh's or even Lawerence Olivier. To be frank, even XXXXXX's Hamlet is better.
