XXXXXXXX' son gets severely wounded during a lion hunt that goes awry. Hercules (a solid and engaging performance by the beefy XXX Park) has to venture into an eerie and dangerous alternate dimension ruled by the evil and vengeful Gia the Earth Goddess (a deliciously wicked portrayal by Gia Sandri) and battle various monsters in order to save his son's soul. Meanwhile, XXX's equally nasty son Antaius (a perfectly hateful turn by Giovanni Cianfriglia) poses as Hercules and takes over an entire city as a cruel and ruthless tyrant. XXXXXXXX Maurizo Lucidi relates the engrossing story at a steady pace and maintains a serious tone throughout. This film begins a little slow, but really starts cooking once XXXXXXXX enters the misty and perilous subterranean spirit world: Rousing highlights include XXXXXXXX grappling with a humanoid lizard beast, XXXXXXXX climbing a giant gnarled tree, and XXXXXXXX being attacked by a bunch of creepy rotting zombies. XXXXXX still, the bizarre spirit world just reeks of spooky atmosphere (gotta love that persistent thick swirling fog!). The strenuous rough'n'tumble mano-a-mano major physical confrontation between XXXXXXXX and Antaius likewise totally rocks. Of course, we also get a big mondo destructo climactic volcanic eruption as well. XXXXXXX Mancori's crisp widescreen cinematography gives the movie an impressively expansive sense of scope. XXX Filippini's robust, rousing score has a nifty majestic sweep to it. Okay, so this flick is an obvious cheapo cute'n'paste job that uses copious footage from both "XXXXXXXX in the Haunted World" and "XXXXXXXX and the Captive Women," but it's still an extremely lively and entertaining romp all the same.
