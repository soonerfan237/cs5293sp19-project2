The entire civilized world by now knows that this is where XXXX Sitka says his immortal "Hold hands, you lovebirds." But XXXXX Howard, Professor of Music, steals the show. Watch him tutoring XXX Green as she fractures the "Voices of Spring." XXXXX Shemp as he shaves by a mirror suspended from the ceiling by a string. Watch him as he gets walloped by XXXXXXXXX McIntyre. Watch him, and you will laugh and learn. Moe is no slouch either. Watch him as he attempts to induce a woman to sit on a bear trap. XXXXX, as usual, is the Zen master of reaction. All in all, one of the very best Stooge shorts. You won't find one weak moment.
