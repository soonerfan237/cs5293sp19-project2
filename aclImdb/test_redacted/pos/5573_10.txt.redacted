Not since J. XXXXXXX Straczynski's Babylon 5, has a television show captured the wonderful art of applying a story arc to a television show. This is easily the best thing on TV right now! The characters are likable and one can easily get attached to them and care for their well-being. The villians are the type you love to hate and leave you wondering what they're up to next. And XXXXX Hensen's puppet work is the most innovative out there. Kudos to XXXXXX S. O'Bannon for a job well done!
