... But it is also XXXXXX's and XXXX's too! Yes, the grumpy captain may not look like XXXX, but it is! XXXXXX and XXXXXX are the best characters, both of them are very sweet and likable. Interestingly, XXXXXX is more of a lady in this than what she usually is today and XXXXXX is less than considerate in this than he is now. XXXX is still the same old meanie, but he looks a bit different. <br /><br />In this famous episode, on board a little steamboat, XXXXXX, XXXXXX and some side characters have a great deal of fun and a great deal of annoyances. Even in their first appearances, the three main characters are very developed. <br /><br />I quite like this episode, although overall I prefer the XXXXXX Mouse in the future. I like the animation, the steamboat and music theme, the clever gags - and of course, XXXXXX and XXXXXX! <br /><br />Like many early cartoons, this is very random, XXXX came up with a very basic plot and just added gags to "gear" it along. There is also a parrot side character who is very annoying and rather unnecessary. These are the things I do not like about it. <br /><br />Another interesting thing about this episode, that a colour version has not been made for it (or if it has, I've never heard about it)! <br /><br />Anyone who just enjoys XXXXXX Mouse and Disney will enjoy this.
