The story is incredible, it begins with a new kid in town named XXX, while on the bus to school, he notices a kid running with no shoes, and on that same day he breaks the big bullies nose who is trying to fight with him. XXX soon discovers that kid is a runaway, and he and his step sister are trying to mess a construction sight, that could kill all the beautiful owls that live there. Roy decides to help them him there fight, Can they win this fight before the smart but bumbling cop XXXX Delinko(Luke Wilson) Stumbles on to them. An enjoyable film, funny and adventurous. I do admire XXXX Wilson for taking this role. I don't think his brother XXXX would even take this role.
