XXXXX Gordon was a first rate serial. I know there were a few goofs, however, i didn't watch it for the flaws. XXXXXX Crabbe is Flash Gordon. He was not a trained actor but he gave a very good, convincing performance. XXXX Rogers is pretty and at 20 yrs. old did, in my opinion, a pretty good job. XXXXXXX Middleton as Emperor Ming, is superb. He was in a lot of other movies, quite versatile, he could sing and dance. His portrayal of "Ming The Merciless", in all 3 XXXXX Gordon serials, was top notch. The rest of the cast also did a very good job. Well, boys and girls, get some popcorn, settle back and enjoy.
