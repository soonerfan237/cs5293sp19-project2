i liked this western Starring XXXXXXXX XXXXX and XXXXX Ford.it's got pretty much everything a western should have.there's gunfights,action,chases on horseback.there's a bit of a romance angle that's hinted at.there's some nice comic relief in the form of XXXXX XXXXXXXX,who plays XXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXX,a character who pretend to be a doddering old fool,but is actually aware of everything going on.Randolph XXXXX plays the town XXXXXXX,and XXXXX Ford Plays Cheyenne Rogers/Bill Smith,a hunted outlaw who eventually tries to change his ways.i liked the different mix of characters in the movie.i didn't find it always fast paced,but i never found it boring either.even though the movie is in 1943,it is in colour. 8/10
