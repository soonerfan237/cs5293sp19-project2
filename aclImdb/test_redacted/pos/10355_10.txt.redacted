This film revolves around an Arabian leader (XXXX) who dies and wants to live on. So a Dr. XXXXX Trenton is being paid to transplant Amirs brain into a "willing" participant. But in the Doctors basement his dwarf assistant Dorro (XXXXXX Rossitto) drains young girls blood for the doctors purposes. So meanwhile Doctor Llyod pays a man to kill the people who assisted XXXX into the country (Which is Reed Hadley, Grant Williams, and various unknown bodyguards.). Grant is the only survivor when his car crashes off the road. While this has happened the doctors other assistant XXX is sent out to get a body for amir and hurts him so badly Dr.Llyod cant operate. Meanwhile, XXXXX finds Amirs "girlfriend" Regina Carrol and tells her his story. Grant sees the man who drove him off the road and XXXXX kills him. Then since XXX failed to get a body D.r Llyod puts Amirs brain into XXXs disfigured body. Then XXXXX and Regina go to the Doctors lab an<br /><br />------------------------SPOILERS------------------------- find out his secret. Soon Amir (XXX) are prancing around killing people and in the muddle of what I think is plot Dr.Llyod has a brain-ray gun which hurts Amir on command. It turns out Dr.Lloyd wants a country in which all scientists can work without law. So then Regina dies. and at the end XXXXX new body (I think) say that it shall be a new country blah blah.<br /><br />I still don't get the ending but overall this was a very enjoyable piece of smelly cheese.This film features Grant Williams in his second to last film roll. I recommend it for any fan of XX Adamson or if you like Brains.
