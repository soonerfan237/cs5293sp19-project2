Story about a widowed father (XXXXXX Rains) bringing up his four daughters. Emma (Gale Page) is loved by big hunky Ernest (XXXX Foran). Thea (Lola Lane) is romanced by an old but wealthy man. Kay (Rosemary Lane) wants to become a singer. Ann (Priscilla Lane) is a romantic. XXXX dead handsome Felix Deitz (Jeffrey Lynn), a business associate of their father, comes to stay with them. All the sisters fall in love with him. Then tough cynical Mickey (XXXX Garfield) enters the picture...<br /><br />Very entertaining movie was a big hit and nominated for five Academy Awards. It's beautifully directed by XXXXXXX Curitz, has a pretty good (if predictable) script and a VERY attractive cast (especially Lynn). Also this was XXXX Garfield's first film and made him a star. This was so popular there were three or four sequels (which I never saw). This is an engrossing, entertaining, big budget soap opera--well worth seeing.
