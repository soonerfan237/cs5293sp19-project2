I'd heard of the case, but hadn't really paid attention during the whole hoopla of XXXXXXX writing the book, Skakel being arrested, etc. However, this movie did an excellent job of detailing XXXXXX, the Skakel brothers, the murder, Mark Fuhrman's involvement and the results of his investigation. I especially liked the flashback scenes with XXXXXX talking about her last summer. The actress who played her literally glowed with life and made it even more poignant that the real XXXXXX was probably like that. It made XXXXXX seem like a real person rather than a victim. I'd definitely recommend watching this.
