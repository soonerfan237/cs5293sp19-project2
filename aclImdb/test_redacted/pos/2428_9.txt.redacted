I wouldn't be so sure to accept the DNA tests as irrefutable evidence against XXXX Anderson. First, read XXXXX Kurth's book on which this film is based. XXXX Anderson knew things that only the real Grand Duchess Anastasia could possibly have known (forensic evidence in XXXX's favor aside). Second, compare the pictures of Anastasia and XXXX Anderson. Anyone can see that they are one-and-the-same person. Third, visit XXXXX Kurth's website (url below) where you can read detailed information about the DNA tests, as well as why Franziska Schanzkowska and Anna Anderson are not the same person (scroll down to the link, "ANNA-ANASTASIA NOTES ON FRANZISKA SCHANZKOWSKA"). Even XXXXXXXXXXXX's relatives believed that their sister and Anna Anderson were not the same person.<br /><br />I for one will always believe that HIH Anastasia Nicolevna Romanova and Anna Anderson were indeed the same person; I will never be swayed to the contrary .<br /><br />www.peterkurth.com
