Very curious that XXXXXXX and Hanks would team up for this, obviously they believe it. XXXXXXX because it should carry the title "Charlie Wilson's War the Lie.<br /><br />How could the time frame leave out the real history that while ridding Afganistan of the Russians the CIA was providing support for the Taliban, and today's World of Terrorism. In 1990, XXX Laden went home to Saudi Arabia as a hero of jihad, who along with his Arab legion, "had brought down the mighty superpower" of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. <br /><br />To avoid any connection to XXXXX Bin Laden is to say again, Hollywood cares little for Historical Truth. XXXXXXX Wilson, a patriot, hardly, more like a congressman gone amok.
