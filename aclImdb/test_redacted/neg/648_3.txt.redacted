"I presume you are here for damage to your mental circuitry." - VAL<br /><br />XXXX Nelson made me watch this...he mentioned it in his book, "Movie Megacheese." I asked myself, "Why would Mike XXXXXX steer me wrong?" I now know why the bots never trusted XXXX Nelson.<br /><br />The music is by John Williams, which is probably part of his payment to the Devil. In fact, I'm sure anyone who worked on this movie is probably in league with ol' XXXXXXXX, or is now cursed, from the Executive Director down to the guy who ran the catering truck outside the studio. Don't watch...for the love of God...don't watch!!! Not even making a copy and showing someone else will un-curse you...I'm doomed now, I understand this. I accept this. But save yourself...
