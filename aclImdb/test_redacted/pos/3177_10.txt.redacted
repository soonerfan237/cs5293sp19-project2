"The Honkers" is probably XXXX XXXXXXX best performance of all time. When we were shooting, everyone connected with the production figured that XXXX was XXXXXXX XXXXX material. Unfortunately, United Artists had a XXXXX XXXX picture in release at the same time and did not devote much attention to "The Honkers". I personally feel this film was under-rated by most critics. XXX XXXXXXXXX's "XXXXXX XXXXXX" was out at the same time and seemed to impress the critics more than our film. Also, XXXXX XXXXXXXXX had a rodeo film out a few months before our release and that might have hurt us, too. The picture is worth watching, if just for the rodeo footage--some of the best ever filmed--shot by XXXXX XXXXXX. The director and my co-writer, XXXXX XXXXX, died a few weeks after the picture's release, cutting short a promising career and leaving behind his lovely wife XXXXX, his daughter, XXXX, and newborn son, XXXXXX. Please give this movie a shot. I'm betting that you'll say it was well worth while. I thank anyone who has taken the time to read this. XXXXXXX Lodge
