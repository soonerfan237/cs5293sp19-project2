As someone who usually despises XXX G, XXX G Indahouse was absolutely brilliant. When I was watching it, I was in a hysterical fit. Yes it is sexist, rude and extremely crude, and I loved it. As some comedies are only have one or two comical scenes, this movie was laugh-a-thon. I have never seen a comedy as original as XXX G Indahouse.For a comedy starring XXX G, this would be worthy of an 8 out 10. Absolutely Brilliant.
