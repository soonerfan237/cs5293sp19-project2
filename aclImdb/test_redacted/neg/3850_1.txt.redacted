This movie is pathetic in every way possible. Bad acting, horrible script (was there one?), terrible editing, lousy cinematography, cheap humor. Just plain horrible.<br /><br />I had seen 'The XXXXXXXXXX' a couple weeks before this movie and I thought it was a dead-ringer for worst movie of the year. Then, I saw 'The XXXX' and suddenly 'The Wishmaster' didn't seem so bad at all.<br /><br />Bad Bad Bad. Excruciatingly bad.
