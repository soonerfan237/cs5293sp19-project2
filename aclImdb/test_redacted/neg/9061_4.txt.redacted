I'm a fan of the old SCTV show from the late 70's and early 80's and XXXX Candy was a major reason why. He was given very funny off the wall characters and was simply hilarious. Unfortunately he could not get these roles to play in the movies. Time after time I was disappointed by the mediocre movies in which he was almost playing the "straight" role instead of the funny guy. "XXXXX and Dangerous" rarely tries to use John's comedic abilities, or that of Harold Ramis, for that matter. It is simply a very predictable cops and robbers type of movie. If you are a XXXX Candy or Harold Ramis fan the movie is watchable, just don't expect to laugh much.
