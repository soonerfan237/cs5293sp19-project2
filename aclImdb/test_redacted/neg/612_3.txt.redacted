I have been a fan of the Carpenters for a long time, read the biography, watched the specials, and saw the Karen Carpenter Story. This movie really didn't show the real XXXXX Carpenter. In the movie she seems to be a shy and a pretty much of loner (except for one girl friend). The real XXXXX Carpenter was much different. She was outgoing and friendly. She had lots of friends, especially XXXXX Newton-John. The movie doesn't even show XXXXX's attempts for a solo album and her meeting Phil Ramone and his wife Itchy "XXXXX". XXXXX knew the real Karen Carpenter in New York. When XXXXX was in New York, she did see a psychologist, but it was voluntary and once a day and then she would leave to go to her hotel room. Also, XXXXX was taking pills to increase her thyroid, so she could loss weight, but stop taking them because the psychologist recommended her not too. Also, the Karen's husband in the movie is named XXX Knight, but in real life was named Tom Burris. Also, XXXXX wasn't divorced from Tom, but only separated. XXXXX was to sign the divorce papers on the day she died. Also, XXXXX found Karen naked in the closet unciousness, unlike in the movie where she was dressed in white. The music was very good. That was the only thing I would recommend on seeing it.
