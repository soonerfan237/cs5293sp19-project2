The above profile was written by me when I used the nick of OldWereWolf56 which is still my email address. I still believe XXXX XXXXXX's character of Frisky is the best XXXXXXXX XXXX's episodes ever and I watch this episode at least once a year as I consider XXXXXX to be a fortunate man as he has many friends who love him dearly. <br /><br />In case many of you are too young to remember, I'm 61, XXXX XXXXXX hosted a children's entertainment show in the 50's I believe called XXXX's XXXX. On it he had three assistants: a cat named Midnight who played the violin, a mouse named XXXXXXX who played an a hand organ and a devilish toad named XXXXXX who's could appear and disappear at will embarrassing many of XXXX's funny guest stars like XXXXX XXXXXXX.
