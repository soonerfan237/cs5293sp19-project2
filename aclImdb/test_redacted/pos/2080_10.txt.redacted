I've seen various Hamlets, and I've taught the play. As I watch XXXXXX, I'm tempted to think that he's every bit as intelligent as Hamlet himself, so alive is he to every nuance of this character's wit. He deepens, rather than solves, every puzzle regarding XXXXXX's character. He illuminates line after line, word after word, shining light into this sparkling mind. At the same time, however, we cringe at the horror Hamlet feels at his betrayal--far more than with any other actor--because XXXXXX feels the pain more profoundly than anyone else. And we shudder at Hamlet's own betrayals, because XXXXXX is not afraid of the baseness to which Hamlet can descend. In short, XXXXXX gives us Hamlet in full, and Hamlet in full is the greatest character in literature. That's why I'm satisfied that XXXXXX's Hamlet is the finest performance I've seen by an actor.
