Greystoke is without doubt the best tarzan movie I have ever seen. XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXX portrays a very believable man trying to return to the world of mankind alongside the fantastic XXX XXXX. The struggle of XXXX to leave the jungle and the apes who raised him is quite stirring. Some very memorable scenes including where XXXXXXX makes the jungle noises to the romantic interest, and the scene where he witnesses his ape father's death. Tarzans feelings for both worlds is well developed and really makes you feel for him.<br /><br />An excellent and underrated movie.
