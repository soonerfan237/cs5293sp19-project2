This miniseries is a reasonable sequel to the original Gone With The Wind. If one views this on its own merit (and not immediately following the original), it comes out pretty good. I am sure that most viewers will question the performances of XXXXXXXX and XXXXX, but it seems unlikely that anyone else could have done better. Many of the characters here are new to this storyline, so comparison in those cases (XXXXX's mother, XXXXX XXXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXX XXXXXXX)is not a problem. No one will every be XXXXXX XXXXX or XXXXX Gable.<br /><br />The best part of the whole production is the beautiful scenery of springtime XXXXXXXXXX and Ireland. Watch it for that alone. Obviously, this was a high budget TV miniseries. It follows the book for a while, then has a totally new plot when XXXXXXXX goes to Ireland.<br /><br />The acting is credible if nothing special--kind of the way I feel about XXXXX XXXXX following XXXX XXXXXXX for XXXXX XXXX.
