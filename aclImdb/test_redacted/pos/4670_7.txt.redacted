Not the film to see if you want to be intellectually stimulated. If you want to have a lot of fun a the theater, however, this is the one. Lots of snappy banter(and some really cheesy banter, too). Mos Def and XXXX Green are very funny as the comic relief. Exciting and creative heists and chase scenes. XXXX Wahlberg and Charlize Theron(sexy)are appealing leads. And XXXXXX Sutherland!
