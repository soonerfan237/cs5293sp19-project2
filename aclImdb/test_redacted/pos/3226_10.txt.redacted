This show is my absolute favorite. This show is intelligent, entertaining and always full of surprises. XXXXXX Graham is perfect as XXXXXXX XXXXXXX, a single mother who is XXXX's best friend. XXXXXX Bledel shines as the beautiful and intelligent XXXX XXXXXXX and XXXXX XXXXX is one of a kind as XXXX's best friend, XXXX XXX. I love the witty dialog, it's what makes it unique about the show. XXXXX Bishop is wicked great as XXXXX XXXXXXX and XXXXXX XXXXXXX is terrific as XXXXXXX XXXXXXX. XXXXX XXXXXXXXX is a joy as XXXX XXXXX and the band members are one of a kind to watch. The Community, XXXX XXXXX, XXXXXXX, Mrs. XXX, XXXXXX XXXXX, XXXX and other's are always laugh out loud funny, quirky and interesting that always makes the snappy one-liners stand out. This show has changed so much over the years that it won't ever get old. XXXXXXX Girls is an original and clever show that keeps you watching. That is how good it is. I give this show a 10/10 rating.
