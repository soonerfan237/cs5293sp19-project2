*** Contains spoilers ***<br /><br />A lovely film this, starring XXXX XXXXXX and the ever wonderful XXXXXX XXXXXXXX. I like XXXXXX XXXXXXXX, out of all his films I've seen to date I've loved every single one of them for many different reasons and The Cure is no different. XXXX XXXXXX does very well in this movie as well. The Cure is a drama/coming of age movie from the viewpoint of an ill child and his friend.<br /><br />The basic idea is: XXXXXX (XXXXXX XXXXXXXX) has AIDS. He ends up befriending the kid next door (XXXX XXXXXX) but XXXX's mum is very narrow-minded, ill-informed and somewhat "thick" when it comes to XXXXXX's illness. She thinks AIDS is contagious like the Common Cold so doesn't want her son going anywhere near XXXXXX.<br /><br />After many attempts at making their own cure with no success, the boys go on their way to New Orleans to find the cure after reading a pamphlet about it. After getting their kicks from Playboy magazine, XXXXXX's health goes south shortly afterwards and as his health detoriates, there's still enough life in the boy alongside XXXX for two pranks of pretending to stop breathing. Unfortunately, poor XXXXXX does indeed die from his illness, leaving poor XXXX behind to wonder why he couldn't find the cure. Throughout the movie he ends up bonding more with XXXXXX's mother than his own.<br /><br />It is a very heartwarming movie to watch and is not absolutely perfect (movies rarely are) but you won't care less about that as you get involved in the film more. A must for XXXXXX XXXXXXXX fans, one of his best performances ever. Very well recommended must-see movie - if you can find a copy :)
