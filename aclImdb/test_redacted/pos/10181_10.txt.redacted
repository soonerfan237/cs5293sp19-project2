While all of the Fleischer/Famous Studios "Superman" cartoons are excellent, "XXXXXXX Dollar Limited," the third in the series, is probably the best of the lot in terms of overall animation, plot, and pacing. Why it wasn't even nominated for an Oscar as XXXX Animated Short for 1942 (Incredibly enough, only the first one was) in inexplicable.<br /><br />Here, Lois Lane is assigned to cover the transfer of one billion dollars in gold to the U.S. Mint. Masked gangsters in their super-powered (for 1942) car take off after the train, determined to get that gold. Without giving too much away, what ensues is a thrill ride for both the characters and the audience, with truth, justice, and XXXXXXXX triumphant at the end.<br /><br />As they did in all the Fleischer/Famous XXXXXXXX cartoons, Clayton "Bud" Collyer and Joan Alexander, who played Clark Kent/XXXXXXXX and Lois Lane on radio, have the voice work honors here, and Fleischer perennial Jack Mercer gets a little to do as one of the bad guys, as well.
