Like the other comments says, this might be surprise to those who haven't seen the work of Jeunet & XXXX or Emir Kusturica. But have you already seen XXXXXXXXXXXX, there is nothing new it this film. I thought XXXXXXXXXXXX was great when it came out, but this film just arrive too late to be of any interest. I don't think it's a worse film than XXXXXXXXXXXX but it's a bore to see it now, like it probably would be to watch XXXXXXXXXXXX again. There is really no point to the film, nothing that really matter or stays with you. There may be a distant similarity to the films of Kusturica, but he's really in a different league, so you should rather go see his films than waste your time on Tuvalu.
