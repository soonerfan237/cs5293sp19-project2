I Love XXXXXX Goes to Jail. It's one of my top 3 favorite Ernest movies. The others being XXXXXX Scared Stupid and XXXXXX Goes to Camp. In this movie Ernest (XXX Varney) works as a janitor for a bank but he wants to be a bank clerk. Soon he is assigned jury duty but soon winds up in trouble when the evil murderer XXXXX Nash (Varney also) knocks him out and switches places with him! Soon Ernest is in jail and is forced to act like XXXX or else XXXX will kill Charlotte Ernest's love interest. When they take Ernest to the electric chair thinking he's Nash he gets so electrocuted he winds up breaking out and goes off and saves Charlotte from the evil Nash! Filled with hilarious scenes and comics XXXXXX Goes to Jail is a movie that'll make you laugh so hard! It still does to me! XXX Varney was such a fantastic actor! He did a good job playing both good guy and bad guy! XXXXXX was like his Toy Story Co star Tom Hanks. No matter what role they played their roles were memorabilia and that's one of the things that XXXXXX's gonna be remembered forever for! R.I.P. XXX Varney 1949-2000. Thank you for bringing XXXXXX and other fantastic characters to life! 10 out of 10!
