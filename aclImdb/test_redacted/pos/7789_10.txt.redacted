I love this film. XXXXXXX Khan's portrayal as Bhalla a.k.a. "Shut up, XXXXXX!" was so hilarious. Whenever he got hit during a fight scene, you could hear him squeal. XXXX Khote is the dumbfounded Robert a.k.a. "Rabbit". I love that XXXXXX Kapoor a.k.a. "Crime XXXXXX Gogo". XXXXXX Rawal's double role is so awesomely hilarious for his portrayal as Ramgopal Bajaj & Shyamgopal Bajaj. XXXXXXX Tandon and Karishma Kapoor are out of this world. My brother does a really good mimicry of Bhalla saying. "Relax. PLEASE relax." I love the scene in which XXXXX Khan puts a laxative in Salman "Muscles" Khan's food which caused the irregular bowel movements forcing him to use the toilet umpteen number of times.
