Based on the memoirs of XXXXX Rose Lee, who painted a much more affectionate picture of their mother than did her sister, actress "Baby" June Havoc, in her autobiography, "Early Havoc" on which "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" was loosely based. I saw XXXXX Merman in the original Broadway production of Gypsy, and she was great as "Mama Rose" but certainly more "Merman" than Rose. I was disappointed with XXXXXXXX Russell's portrayal in the 1962 movie version. An otherwise excellent actress, XXXXXXX was a very wooden substitute for Merman. XXXXX Midler, by contrast, was better and more believable than Merman and I'd recommend her performance as the definitive one.
