In the mountains of Japan, forlorn young artist XXXXXX Hayakawa (as Tatsu aka "The Dragon Painter") paints magnificent landscapes. He prays "Divinity" will restore his fiancée, whom he believes was changed into a dragon, 1,000 years ago. Meanwhile, in Tokyo, an forlorn older painter, XXXXXX Peil (as Kano Indara) laments not having a son to carry on his family line of artists. When XXX Peil sees XXX Hayakawa's paintings, he sees a painter worthy to become his "son and disciple." Hayakawa also falls in love with XXXX's daughter Tsuru Aoki (Ume-Ko), believing she's the reincarnation of his long lost princess. But, with his love fulfilled, XXXXXXXX loses his ability to paint <br /><br />An introduction notes, "'The Dragon Painter' was originally released in 1919 by the Haworth Pictures, a Hollywood-based production company formed the previous year by Sessue XXXXXXXX, a Japanese-born actor who enjoyed great popularity in the silent period. The film was ninth of twenty-two features produced by XXXXXXX, each of which was tailored to Hayakawa's talents and to his stock company of Japanese actors." Fortunately, a print of this film was found, in France, and restored.<br /><br />The description, "The Dragon Painter is a fantasy-allegory of love and creative inspiration that is lost when longing is fulfilled," is accurate. "With its production, XXXXXXXX intended to provide a different view of Japanese culture to American audiences, avoiding the stereotyping, violence, and melodramatic conflict expected in 'Oriental' films of the period." XXXXXXXX was successful in that part of his goal; although, this film probably did not and will not appeal to most viewers, and is not the best example of its intent.<br /><br />**** The Dragon Painter (9/28/19) William Worthington ~ Sessue XXXXXXXX, Edward Peil, Tsuru Aoki
