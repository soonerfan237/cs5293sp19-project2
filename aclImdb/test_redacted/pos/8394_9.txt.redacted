I am a big Gone With The Wind nut but I was disappointed that both Gone With The Wind the movie and XXXXXXXX the mini series are so different from the books. Gone With The Wind left so many things out in the movie that were in the book and they did the same with XXXXXXXX. Both were good movies, but I really liked both books better. There were so many characters left out of XXXXXXXX, and the ages of some characters didn't seem to match up with the book. The time lines don't match up either. XXXXXXXX realizes she is pregnant on the ship to Ireland in the book, but she realizes it when she is throwing up while in Savahanna. Also XXXXX is made out to be an ugly monkey like woman in the book and the movie casted XXXX XXXXX to play her, who is obviously not an ugly woman. Over all, XXXXXXXX is a good movie, and it helps anyone who was disappointed in the way Gone With The Wind ended, to see what might have happened if XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX had lived to write a sequel herself.
