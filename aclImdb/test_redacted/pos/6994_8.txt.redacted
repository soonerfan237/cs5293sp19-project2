XXXXX Black is a surprisingly good movie. I was not a fan of Vin diesel before I saw XXXXX black, but after seeing XXXXX Black my respect for XXX XXXXXX has gone up. He did a great job playing XXXXXXX a man wanted for many murders. His character is cold and makes many decisions that surprised me, like near the end XXXXXXX was going to get on the ship and save his own ass leaving everyone behind to die. I like this movie and how it deals with human instinct. This movie is low budget but this movie goes to show you don't need amazing special effects and lots of money to make a good movie, I think all the characters made this movie. I give this movie 8 out of 10 ;)
