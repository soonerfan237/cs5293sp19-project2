I love the way he experiments. Ab Tak XXXXXXX was a thrill to watch just as much Satya and company was. Jatin the new comer also lived up to his role and XXXX Patekar was at his best. XXXXXX was really irritating but I think he fit the character he was playing - he had really ugly teeth. The story has a great progress and no songs in the movie makes it better. I only wish he signs up XXXXXX for his other up coming movies. I think they are the best director and actress combination I have seen. I have not seen XXXXX as yet but I am looking forward for it. I for some reason don't find XXXXX Maali that exciting to watch on the screen - unlike Urmila.
