When I was a child my grandmother took me to see this movie. And I fell in love with it. I admired XXXXXXX Dandridge so very much and wanted to be like her. I fell in Love with XXXXXX Poitier. XXXXX Bailey made me laugh. And XXXXX Davis Jr. was so great as Sportin Life. The music was just breath taken. When I had my first son and the movie came on TV I let him see it, and to this day he has never forgotten this movie. He loved it. I will always remember XXXXX and Bess. It has a special place in my heart then and now. I really wish that they would restore this movie, because it was one of the greatest movies there has ever been with an all star "XXXXX Cast".
