The 3 stars are for XXXXXXX Seymour Hoffman. Nothing else and no one else in this movie deserves even a wee smidgen of a star. Well, OK, XXX Adams deserves a wee smidgen, but the smidgenometer doesn't seem to be working, so I'll stick with 3. XXX Hanks...nothing. XXXXX Roberts...nothing. XXXX Nichols...do you see a trend yet? XXXXX Sorkin...OMG, not a chance. <br /><br />I could rant on for several paragraphs about the way XXXXXXX Wilson's War glosses over history, morality, legitimacy and so on, but I don't think any such rant could outweigh the gushing of Aaron Sorkin fans. The rest of you, beware.Spend your movie money elsewhere.<br /><br />Still, if you're looking for a pithy comment, here's mine. You can put hot fudge sauce on a pile of garbage, but it changes nothing. Garbage is garbage and so is XXXXXXX Wilson's War.
