Seeing XXXXXX without Hardy in a film seems strange, yet it's entertaining all the same. It's a well done parody of what became a classic silent film and it showcases XXXX's talents very well. While his pictures with XXXXXX Hardy were great, these early solo efforts give you an idea of how skilled he was at his craft and how great he might have been had he continued in the tradition of Keaton and Chaplin as an individual star on his own. The dance sequence with his real-life wife in the caf√© scene is the best part of the picture, and has some pretty funny bits to go with XXXXXX's excellent dance steps. And the bullfight climax is a gem, as even the bull takes a pratfall. And I like the irony in the scene where he's buried in hats and comes up wearing his familiar XXXXXX and Hardy bowler hat. As much as I love the Laurel and XXXXX team and feel that there was never a funnier comedy duo on screen during their prime, it's nice to see them on their own once in a while (check out THE FIGHTING KENTUCKIAN that XXXXX made with the Duke as another fine example.)
