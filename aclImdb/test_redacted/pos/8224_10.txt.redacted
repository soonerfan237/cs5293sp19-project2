The Regard of Flight, written and performed by XXXX Irwin, is a true classic theatre piece which translated quite well to the small screen. Full of quick and sparkling dialog and some of the best physical comedy of the decade, it is head and shoulders above 99% of "Comedy" as it is presented today. I am sure it will one day take its rightful place with such great shows as "The Fantastiks", and "Waiting for XXXXX." Why it isn't available on DVD yet is a mystery and a tragedy.
