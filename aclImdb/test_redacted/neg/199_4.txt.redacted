Just watched on UbuWeb this early experimental short film directed by XXXXXXX Vance and Orson Welles. Yes, you read that right, XXXXX Welles! Years before he gained fame for radio's "The War of the Worlds" and his feature debut XXXXXXX Kane, Welles was a 19-year-old just finding his muse. Besides Vance and XXXXXX, another player here was one Virginia Nicholson, who would become Orson's first wife. She plays a woman who keeps sitting on something that rocks back and forth courtesy of an African-American servant (XXXX Edgerton in blackface). During this time a man (Welles) keeps passing her by (courtesy of the scene constantly repeating). I won't reveal any more except to say how interesting the silent images were as they jump-cut constantly. That's not to say this was any good but it was fascinating to watch even with the guitar score (by XXXXX Morotta) added in the 2005 print I watched. Worth a look for Welles enthusiasts and anyone with a taste of the avant-garde.
