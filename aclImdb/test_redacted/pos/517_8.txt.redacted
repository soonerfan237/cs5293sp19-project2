I must confess that I've been a huge fan of the almighty XXXXX "the Hoff" Hasselhoff ever since he starred in the hit 80's TV series "XXXXXX XXXXX." Whether it's his extraordinary debut as a libidinous high school basketball player in the hilariously raunchy "Revenge of the Cheerleaders" or his brilliant portrayal of a dashing prince in the schlocky sci-fi gem "Starcrash," the Hoff has proved time and time again that he's a simply terrific (and shamefully underrated) actor supreme. The Hoff excels here as XXXX, a cynical and skeptical photographer who along with his repressed virginal writer girlfriend Leslie (attractive brunette XXXXXX XXXXXXXX) investigates a seedy dilapidated haunted hotel located on a remote island off the coast of Massachussetts. They're doing research on witchcraft throughout the ages and the hotel's last owner was an actress who allegedly practiced the black arts. A bickering family also shows up on the premises to check out the hotel. Pretty soon various folks begin to get bumped off in assorted gruesome ways by the mysterious Lady in Black (an effectively eerie XXXXXXXXX XXXX).<br /><br />Granted, the rest of the cast gives the Hoff a run for his money: the ever-perky XXXXX XXXXX projects her customary charming flair as a spunky pregnant woman who winds up becoming possessed (natch!), legendary jazz singer XXXXX XXXX bitches it up with gleeful aplomb as a snippy old bat (poor XXXXX winds up being incinerated alive after she has her lips sewn shut and she's hung upside down in a chimney), and gorgeous blonde XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX oozes considerable sex appeal from every fetching pore as a lusty slut. XXXXXXXX Laurenti's competent direction, a suitably creepy atmosphere, XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX's slick, glossy cinematography (the fluid prowling XXXXXXXXX tracking shots are especially nice), the gaudy special effects, XXXXX XXXXX XXXXXX and XXXXX XXXXXX's spirited shuddery'n'spooky score, and the gory, sadistic violence are all up to par. But ultimately it's the tremendously dynamic and charismatic presence of the one and only the Hoff which makes this choice tasty chunk of tacky Italian horror cheese such a winner: He takes his shirt off once (hubba hubba!), gets sprayed with blood, and -- WARNING: Major *SPOILER* ahead -- even meets a pleasingly grisly untimely end. Produced by none other than XXX XXXXXXX, this picture overall rates as good, sleazy fun.
