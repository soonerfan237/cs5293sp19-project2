Now that I have seen it, it was NOT what I was expecting, at least not until the very END. I read some of the other reviews before picking up a used copy of this from Amazon and was glad I did. Having been first introduced to XXXX's work via XXXXXX, I was curious to how he'd treat the genre and was rather pleased at the clever manner in which he executed it. I think XXXX has matured in terms of presentation because while XXXXXX and some of his other work has very nice and deliberate camera work, he has some nice innovations in XXXXXX that I had not seen in other vamp movies. For example the scene where XXXXXX XXXXX is realizing the "beast" growing within him as he gives his shoes to the always barefoot Tae-ju and he is able to SEE the blood pumping through Tae-ju's skin and his eye's widen in blood-lust for it. That was a nice effect. I was also happy that XXXX did not CG the crap out of the movie and the is in fact very little CG at all. I came away from XXXXXX being totally set up to think one thing was going to happen and get taken for a ride in true XXXX fashion. Additionally, I liked that XXXX played with a little symbolism and reversal whereas we don't usually get this is Asia cinema. During the beginning of the movie we see the plot develop slowly and get to know the characters and you feel like an invisible observer to the thing that are transpiring. XXXX treats you a little like Ghost of Christmas future coming to show you, albeit a bit boringly, what life is like outside your world. Ah, but then we start to feel a little kinship with the befallen XXXXXX and his burgeoning lust for Tae-ju and conflict with duty as a priest. We almost start to root for them even until XXXX not so nicely slaps us back into reality and we really see that in the end XXXXXX is a movie about moral dilemma and right and wrong. It won't spoil it if I tell you to watch XXXXXX from the mindset of a priest and I think you'll come away from it with what XXXX wants you to come away with. Don't expect XXXXXX and stylization because that's not what you'll get here. A very interesting take on the genre indeed. Those who missed the MANY literary elements and religious allusions watched some other movie, not XXXXXX. After XXXXXX, watch Let The Right One IN, it's also not what you'll expect either.
