XXXXX Apna Apna is by far my second favorite comedy of all time, first being XXXXX XXXXX (even though that was technically a drama). Story is nothing groundbreaking, but the complications that are added to it make it awesome. XXXXX XXXX is a total cartoon. Just watch his expressions in the song XXX XXXX aur yeh doori. He is amazingly good at comedy, I never knew. XXXXXX XXXX was also good as the somewhat dimmer of the two characters. The noises he makes are almost as funny as XXXXX's faces. XXXXXXX and karisma serve their purpose but are nothing amazing. The real pick of the lot is XXXXXX XXXXX as usual.<br /><br />The plot is rather simple, XXXX (XXXXX) and Prem (XXXXXX) are useless sons of poor fathers. They don't believe in hard work and just want to get rich the easy way. So both their brains come across an idea to woo a rich man's (XXXXXX XXXXX) daughter (XXXXXXX XXXXXX) who comes to India to look for a husband. So XXXX and Prem meet on the trip and join hands to drive off the hundreds of other men trying to marry this girl. When they succeed, they now have to get rid of each other. Somehow both of them get into XXXXXXX's house, XXXX as an injured guy and Prem as his doctor. From here on they try to oust each other. But things are complicated as XXXXXXX's friend (XXXXXXX XXXXXX) falls for Prem and pursues him. And rich man's evil twin brother (XXXXX also) tries to get rid of the heiress and her father so he will inherit the money and sends in his two most trusted but bumbling fools to do the dirty work.<br /><br />This is a movie you do not want to miss. Watch it! It will be worth it. I even own the DVD, its that good. And if you like this movie, I'd also recommend Gol Maal if you haven't already watched it. Other good comedies are XXXXX XXXXX and XXXX XXXXX (new).
