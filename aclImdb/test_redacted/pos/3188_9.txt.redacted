This is a very sweet coming-of-age movie, very funny, and Russell Crowe is amazing! Those who know him only from XXXXXXXXX will be surprised to see the range of his acting abilities. XXXXXX Baskin (his character) is one of the best onscreen nerdy virgins I have ever seen1 Watch this movie--how can we get it re-released in NTSC format?<br /><br />
