The Man with XXXXXX's Face sets it self up to mine the viewers nostalgia for the late 30's-late 40's film era. It fails miserably for several reasons. First, Sacchi, while looking reasonably like XXXXXX and even speaking like him on occassion and using his mannerisms, completely lacks any of XXXXXX's charisma or acting ability. This is really apparent whenever XXXXXX is not clearly imitating a scene from one of Bogart's films. Second, the film does not have the first rate character actors XXXXXX was able to work with. There are no XXXXX Lorre's or Sydney Greenstreet's in this one, folks. Sure we are treated to performances by XXXXXX Buaeno, Olivia Hussey and George Raft amongst others, but they just aren't of the same caliber (or aren't given enough screen time or are miscast). Third, the attempts at "modern" humor all fall through. All of the underwear jokes, having XXXXXXX almost *never* remove that damn hat and trench coat (even though Bogart would have), etc. just aren't funny and really pull down this film. Fourth, I've never heard a goofier theme song this side of Mitchell. Finally, the film's false reverence for Bogart (and other classic actors work) is truly irritating. Bogart almost *never* played a straight hero, on those occasions he was a hero. He played complicated characters. This movie makes XXXXXX out to be a trigger-happy, moralistic do-gooder. While this may have been true about some film characters, XXXXXX's characters rarely fit that bill. It's movies like this that make people unexposed to the cinema of the past think that all of it is hokey, "good guy beats the bad guys and gets the girl" crap with low production values.
