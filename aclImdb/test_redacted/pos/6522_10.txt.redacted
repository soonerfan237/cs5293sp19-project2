XXXX was such a great show.It was simple but somehow very addicting.I can still remember the days when I'd watch this on XXXX XX XXXXXXXXX ,but then XXXX XX did the unforgivable.XXXX XX became like that older relative that tries to act "hip" and "funky fresh".*shudder*They became like that relative who tries to act all cool ,but the attempt is a cheesy disaster.They pulled Coconut XXXX's XXXXX XXXXX XXXXXX and all the other good shows to put on some of the most pointless shows I've ever seen In my life(XXXXXX XXXX).The only thing that keeps me watching KWB anymore is the occasional bits of the old shows and the anime on 4kids.It was such a huge mistake to pull this show off of the schedule.This brings me back to my first point... BRING IT BACK!!!
