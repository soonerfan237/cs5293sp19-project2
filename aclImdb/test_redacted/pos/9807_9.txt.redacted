You got it right! XXXXX was XXXX's imaginary friend through the whole movie, even at the beginning when on their way to California. His mother knew of XXXXX and didn't discourage XXXX leaning on XXXXX since imaginary friends are common with young children.<br /><br />That's why they both got stomach aches at the same time. That's why the boys' were so close.<br /><br />At the end XXXX was letting XXXXX go. The "King" was arrested. XXXX could go on without XXXXX. It's also why XXXX's mother didn't seem disturbed when XXXX received the postcard (XXXX had written & mailed) from XXXXX the Ol' West tourist stop and the other postcards from all over the world. You noticed XXXX's mother turned the first card over and looked at the postmark. What a great mom doing the best she could in the late sixties.<br /><br />A 9 out of 10 for me. Brought back memories...
